<p class="chaptitle">THE YELLOW-HAIRED CAVALRY CHIEF ON THE
WAR TRAIL.</p>


<p>"Hold up yer hands thar, ye varmints. Ef
his hair air gray I kin swar this chile's hand air
as steddy and his eye as sure az they war twenty
years ago. Bein' sich a heathen, I reckon ye
don't know that wine improves wid age; ther
older it air, ther better, an' I s'pose thar's a likeness
between wine an' me, az ther feller sez.
Keep them hands steddy, my red cock-o'-the-walk.
Now, I'm goin' ter caterkize ye 'cordin' ter
my own style. Fust and foremost, who air ye?"</p>

<p>The buckskin-clad hunter held his long rifle
nicely poised, and the bead at the end was in a
line with the object of his speech.</p>

<p>Under such peculiar circumstances the warrior
(for his color proclaimed him an Indian) could
do no less than remain quiet, although from his
evident uneasiness it was plainly seen that he did
so under protest.</p>

<p>Even in this sad predicament, the boasting
qualities of his race seemed to be predominant.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" he ejaculated, slapping his dusky
chest vigorously, "me big chief. Hunter must
hear of Yellow Hawk. Big chief, great brave.
Take much scalps. Hab hunter's in little while.
What name? ugh!"</p>

<p>The leather-clad ranger gave a laugh that was
not all a laugh, insomuch that it appeared to be
a loud chuckle coming up from his boots.</p>

<p>His thin face was a little wrinkled, and the tuft
of hair upon his chin of the same iron-gray color
as the scalp mentioned by the redskin; but no
one would be apt to judge, taking into consideration
the man's strength and stubborn endurance,
that he was over seventy years of age.</p>

<p>Yet such was the actual fact; for some fifty
years this ranger had roamed the wild West from
the frozen region of the polar seas to the torrid
climes of the Isthmus; and everywhere had his
name been reckoned a tower of honesty, strength
and power.</p>

<p>Though probably few men had had half of his
experience among the redskins of the mountains
and prairies, there was something so charmingly
fresh in the remark of his red acquaintance that
made the ranger more than smile.</p>

<p>"Purty good fur ye, Yaller Hawk. I won't furgit
yer name, and by hokey I reckon I'll plug ye
yet, ef things keep on ther way they seem set on
going. Az ter my name, thet's another goose. I
don't s'pose ye ever hearn tell o' such a cuss az
Pandy Ellis, now did ye?"</p>

<p>Again that queer chuckle, for the Indian had
slunk back, his black eyes fastened upon the
ranger's face, with a sort of dazed expression.</p>

<p>It appeared as though Pandy was known to
him by report, if not personally.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Sharp shot! Heavy knife! Big chief!
Ugh!"</p>

<p>"I reckon," returned the old ranger dryly.</p>

<p>Half a moment passed, during which neither of
them spoke.</p>

<p>Pandy's grim features had resumed their usual
aspect, and there was actually a scowl upon his
face as he gazed steadily at the redskin.</p>

<p>"Chief," said he at length, "fur I reckon I kin
b'lieve ye that fur an' say ye air a chief, I'm going
ter ax ye sum questions, an' I want square
answers to every wun o' them. Fust o' all,
what'd ye shoot at me fur?" and Pandy glanced
at his shoulder, where a little tear told where the
bullet had gone.</p>

<p>"Me see through bushes; tink was Blackfoot
squaw. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Yas, I reckon. Werry plausible, az ther feller
sez, but two thin. Wal, we'll let that pass, seein'
az no harm war done. I forgive ye, chief. Receive
a benediction, my red brother. Let that lie
pass ter yer credit. Now, my painted scorpion,
look me full in the eye. <i>What hez Sitting Bull done
wid my pard?</i>"</p>

<p>This was uttered in a slow, but emphatic tone.</p>

<p>The Indian either could not or would not understand;
he shook his head.</p>

<p>Pandy took a step forward, and his rifle was
again raised menacingly.</p>

<p>"Looky hyar, ye lump o' dough, I'm inquirin'
respectin' Bolly Wherrit, the big rover o' thar
plains. White Thunder, do ye understand?"</p>

<p>Whether it was the hunter's threatening attitude
that scared the warrior, or that he suddenly
realized what was meant, can never be made
manifest; certain it is he remembered just at this
critical period.</p>

<p>"Ugh! mean White Thunder; him dead."</p>

<p>"Another lie. Now, redskin, how did he come
ter die?" asked Pandy, who, although not believing
this assertion, began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>"Wagh! eat too much. Dine with Sitting Bull.
No hab good tings afore; stuff full and burst.
Run all ober. Ugh!" grunted this savage composedly.</p>

<p>"Thunder! thet air rich. How the ole man'll
larf wen he hears it. Allers prided himself on
bein' a light feeder; eat az much az a bird, him
that I've seen git away wid a hull haunch o' venison
while I war chawin' the tongue. Now, Yaller
Hawk, allow me ter say I don't believe a word
ye've sed; may be all is az true az Scripture, but I
wouldn't like ter swar ye. I'll tell ye what I
think. Bolly air a prisoner in yer camp. I tole
him twar a fool's errand he started on, but a
willing man must hev his way, az the feller sez,
so he started widout me. I'm goin' into yer
camp; tell Sitting Bull that I'll see him widin a
week, and listen, Yaller Hawk. Does ther eagle
car fur its mate? will thar she bar fight fur her
cubs? Wal, I love Bolly Wherrit; he air my life,
all I care about livin' fur. Mark my words, redskin;
if any harm comes ter White Thunder, I
swar Sitting Bull and his chiefs shall <i>go under</i>.
Do yer hear? Then don't fail to report. That's
all; ye can retire now, az ther cat sed when it
had ther mouse by ther nape o' ther neck. Come,
git, absquatulate, vamose the ranche."</p>

<p>An Indian's code is "an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth."</p>

<p>Yellow Hawk had attempted the ranger's life,
and he expected the latter to take his in just retaliation.</p>

<p>Therefore, he was not a little surprised at the
words of his enemy, nor did his amazement retard
his progress.</p>

<p>A moment and he was beyond the range of
vision, having vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis, the trapper chief, was alone. He
did not stay in his exposed position long, however,
knowing full well the treacherous character
of the foes he had to deal with, but plunging
among the undergrowth himself, in a direction
almost opposite to the one taken by the Indian,
he made his way along, aiming for a certain
spot.</p>

<p>This proved to be a small creek, on the further
bank of which his horse was tethered.</p>

<p>Crossing over, the ranger mounted and rode
away. The animal he bestrode was no mustang,
but a tall, broad-breasted horse, capable not only
of carrying heavy burdens and making fast time,
but also of keeping up his pace.</p>

<p>Many years ago Pandy owned a quaint steed
called Old Nancy, and in memory of that faithful
equine friend had this animal been named.</p>

<p>Reaching the prairie, the ranger dashed out
upon the open space and cantered along toward
the north.</p>

<p>The grass was already high, and dotted here
and there with beautiful wild flowers, that
seemed to make the scene one of enchantment.</p>

<p>His gray eyes swept both the horizon and the
ground before him with customary caution.</p>

<p>All at once the ranger brought Nancy to an
abrupt halt, threw himself from the saddle and
bent down to examine tracks in the soft earth.</p>

<p>"Glory! kin I b'lieve my eyes? A hull army o'
'em, az I'm a sinner. Ther report I heerd must
be true then. My yallar-haired chief air on the
war-trail, and when Custer gits on ther rampage
thar's blood on ther moon."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SITTING BULL'S GANG OF RED MARAUDERS.</p>


<p>The slanting rays of the rising sun fell upon an
immense Indian encampment that stretched for
several miles along the left bank of the Little
Horn, and could hardly have been less than a
mile in width.</p>

<p>Doubtless such a gathering of redmen had not
taken place for many years.</p>

<p>In addition to the several lodges composing
the village proper, scores and even hundreds of
temporary brush-wood shelters had been hastily
constructed, which significant fact went to show
that this immense assemblage of warriors, numbering
very nearly three thousand, was a gathering
from different tribes.</p>

<p>That mischief was intended by these warlike
Sioux could be presumed from the fact of their
being painted as for battle.</p>

<p>The sun had been shining for some time when
two mounted Indians, coming from the plains
away beyond the distant range of hills, appeared
almost simultaneously on the high bluffs that
lined the right bank of the river.</p>

<p>Dashing down the steep inclined plane they
forded the Little Horn and rode directly into the
village.</p>

<p>One lodge, more conspicuous than its fellows,
was situated near the center of the place, and
even an inexperienced eye might have discovered
in it the resting-place of a great chief, even
though the only conviction came from seeing the
many sub-chiefs that hovered near by.</p>

<p>These two hard riders reached the lodge at
nearly the same time, and throwing themselves
to the ground, left their sweltering horses to take
care of themselves, while they entered with that
boldness the bearers of exciting news generally
possess.</p>

<p>Old Sitting Bull was busily engaged in an earnest
confab with some half dozen chiefs, and although
he spoke only once in a while, his words
were listened to respectfully by the rest.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the new-comers, and
a hush fell upon the assembly, for something
seemed to tell them that great news was on the
tapis. Yellow Hawk, (for this discomfited chief
was one of the hard riders) managed to get in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
first word, and when it was known that the far-famed
Pandy Ellis was in their immediate neighborhood,
more than one of these dusky braves
felt his heart beat faster, for there was a terrible
meaning attached to the old ranger's honest
name, for all evil-doers.</p>

<p>When, however, the second courier spoke, a
wild excitement seized upon the chiefs.</p>

<p>Custer the hard fighter, the yellow-haired devil,
whom they had always feared, was charging along
their trail and aiming for the village like a thunderbolt,
with his cavalry regiment at his back.</p>

<p>Indians are not accustomed to speaking their
thoughts during times of excitement, but the
news loosened their tongues, and for several moments
a hubbub arose in the head chief's lodge.</p>

<p>In the midst of this several white men, garbed
as Indians, but with their faces painted, entered.</p>

<p>A moment only was needed to become acquainted
with the state of affairs, and then one of them,
a squatty individual, who had long been a pest to
the border, under the name of Black Sculley, spoke
a few words in the ear of Sitting Bull.</p>

<p>Whatever he said does not concern my narrative,
but it had its effect upon the chief, who immediately
became calm, and made a motion toward
one who stood at the entrance of the lodge
as a sort of door-keeper.</p>

<p>This individual signaled the waiting chiefs outside,
and in another moment fully forty well-known
leading Sioux were clustered together.</p>

<p>Indian councils from the time of Red Jacket and
Tecumseh back to time immemorial have been
windy affairs, in which much eloquence and debate
was needed to settle that which had already
been decided before the argument commenced;
for being natural born orators the red sons of the
plains and forest liked to hear their own voices.</p>

<p>In contrast with these, this council was very
brief, only lasting about five minutes.</p>

<p>This proved that their dealings with the whites
had affected the redskins.</p>

<p>After the chiefs separated, there was a wild
commotion in the immense village.</p>

<p>Horses neighed, dogs barked, men shouted, and
the din was increased by the thunder of hoofs as
squad after squad of mounted braves, led by their
chiefs, dashed down to the river and forded it.</p>

<p>In a lodge not far removed from that of the
great chief, a leather-clad ranger lay, bound hand
and foot.</p>

<p>It was Bolly Wherrit, the old-time chum and
friend of Pandy Ellis.</p>

<p>He had been taken prisoner, fighting against
overwhelming numbers, and had lain here without
food for over twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>What his fate would doubtless be the old ranger
knew well enough, but he had faced death too
often to flinch now.</p>

<p>Something seemed to trouble him, however,
for he occasionally gave vent to a groan and
rolled restlessly about.</p>

<p>"Cuss the thing," he muttered at length.
"Bolly Wherrit, ye're growing inter yer second
childhood; thar's eggscitin' times comin' off now,
and hyar ye lie tied neck and heel. Didn't I hyar
what them infernal renegades talked 'bout jest
then. Custer, my pet, a-comin', tearin', whoopin'
at this hyar town wid his cavalry. Lordy, won't
the yaller-har'd rooster clean 'em out; don't I
know him though. Wonder ef Major Burt air
along. Why didn't I wait fur Pandy. T'ole man
tole me I'd get inter trouble, but consarn the
luck, in course a woman's at the head o' it.
Cud I stand it wen that purty face, runnin' over
wid tears, war raised ter mine, an' she a pleadin'?
No, sir, fool or not, I'd run through fire fur a woman,
'cause I kain't never furget my mother. That
gal is in this hyar village. 'Cause why? Sumfin
tells me so, and I've hed that feeling afore. Beside,
ain't ole Sittin' Bull hyar, and cudn't I swar I heerd
the voice o' that white devil she tole me about,
Pedro Sanchez she called him, right aside this
lodge. Bolly Wherrit, thar's no good talking, ef
ye don't get outen this place in an hour, ye'll
never leave it alive, fur when Custer sails in he
never backs out, and the reds hev a failing fur
braining their prisoners, 'specially men folks.
Now do ye set ter work, and show these red
whalps that a border man air sumpin like a bolt
o' lightning."</p>

<p>From the manner in which Bolly set to work,
it would be supposed that he had been making
efforts at freeing his arms for some time back,
and had only stopped to rest while holding this
one-sided conversation with himself.</p>

<p>Somehow or other he had found a piece of
a broken bottle, and had been sawing away at the
cord securing his hands with this, one end being
thrust into the ground, and held upright in the
proper position.</p>

<p>Although his wrists and hands were badly
lacerated by this rough method, the ranger possessed
the grit to persevere.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after his soliloquy his hands
separated. Bolly gave a sigh of relief, held the
bloody members up for inspection, and then,
without an instant's delay, seized upon the sharp-edged
glass.</p>

<p>It had taken him hours to free his arms, as he
was unable to see, and his position, while working,
exceedingly uncomfortable; the cord securing
his feet he severed in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Something like a chuckle escaped his lips as he
stood upright. There was a mighty stretching of
those cramped and tired limbs, and then Bolly
was ready for business.</p>

<p>An ardent desire had seized upon him to take
part in the attack which brave Custer was sure to
make.</p>

<p>Fastening the cords around his ankles in a way
that looked very secure, but which was treacherous,
the ranger lay down upon the ground.</p>

<p>With his hand he quietly raised one of the
skins composing the lodge and peeped out.</p>

<p>The opening thus formed was not over a
couple of inches in length, but his keen eyes
could see everything that was passing.</p>

<p>A grim smile lit up the ranger's features, as he
saw the wild excitement that reigned throughout
the camp.</p>

<p>"Ther askeered o' Custer; they know him
mighty well, but by thunder they mean ter fight.
It'll be the biggest Indian fight that this country
ever saw, bust my buttons now ef 'twon't. Bolly
Wherrit, ye must let t'other matter drop, and sail
inter this, fur it'll be full o' glory and death."</p>

<p>Alas! how the words of the old ranger came
true has been made manifest in a way that has
caused the whole country to mourn.</p>

<p>Death was fated to ride triumphant in the
ravine on the other shore; this valley would see
such a red slaughter as the annals of Indian history
have seldom presented.</p>

<p>Several hours passed on.</p>

<p>The warriors were too busy with other matters
to even think of their prisoner just then, much
less visit his secure quarters, and so Bolly was
undisturbed.</p>

<p>Noon came and went.</p>

<p>The hot sun beat down upon the earth with
great fury, but a gentle breeze in the valley did
much toward cooling the air on this fatal twenty-fifth
of June.</p>

<p>All at once the old trapper leaped wildly to his
feet; this same light wind had carried to his ear
the distant but approaching crash of firearms and
the wild yells of opposing forces.</p>

<p>His frame quivered and seemed to swell with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Yaller Har's at work. The best Indian fighter
that ever lived hez struck ile. Bolly Wherrit,
now's the time fur yer chance at glory. Whoop!
hooray!"</p>

<p>With this shout the ranger burst out of the lodge
like a thunderbolt, and not even giving himself
an instant's time for reflection, hurled his body
upon a guard who leaned idly against a post, listening
to the sounds of battle.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RECKLESS GALLOP IN THE JAWS OF DEATH.</p>


<p>A column of mounted men wearing the national
colors, and headed by a group of officers,
were making their way in a westerly direction.
In the advance rode a body of Crow Indians,
and on either flank were the scouts of the regiment&mdash;over
seven hundred in all, and some of
the most gallant fighters on the plains.</p>

<p>Among that group of officers, every man of
whom had honor attached to his name, rode one
who seemed conspicuous both for his bearing
and peculiar appearance. His form was rather
slender, and indeed one might call it womanly,
but the face above, with its prominent features,
redeemed it from this characteristic. The features
themselves might be styled classic in their
strange light, having a Danish look. Surmounting
this clearly cut face was the well-known yellow
hair, worn long on the neck.</p>

<p>Such was the gallant Custer. He had always
been a dashing cavalry leader, and with Crook
and McKenzie rendered the Union efficient service
under General Sheridan during the late unpleasantness.</p>

<p>The morning was half over when the command
was ordered to halt for two reasons.</p>

<p>One of these was that his scouts had brought
word that the large Indian village, whose presence
in the vicinity had been strongly suspected,
was only a short distance ahead; the other that a
single horseman was sighted coming along their
back trail at a furious gallop.</p>

<p>Custer had suspected this latter might be a
bearer of dispatches from his commander, General
Terry, from whom he had separated at the
mouth of the Rosebud, the commander going up
the river on the supply steamer <i>Far West</i>, to
ferry Gibbons' troops over the water.</p>

<p>When, however, the horseman came closer, it
was discovered that he was no blue coat, but a
greasy leather-clad ranger. The individual rode
directly up to the officers, and his quick gray eye
picking out Custer, he extended a horny palm.</p>

<p>"Can I believe my eyes?" exclaimed the general;
"gentlemen, let me make you acquainted
with my old friend, Pandy Ellis, the best Indian
fighter that ever raised a rifle, and one whom I am
proud to shake hands with."</p>

<p>"Come, come, general, don't butter it too thick.
Yer sarvint, gentlemen. I'm on hand ter see ther
fun, wich air all I keer 'bout. Don't mind me no
more than ef I warn't in these hyar diggin's,"
protested Pandy, modestly.</p>

<p>"We shall do no such thing, old friend. Colonel
Cooke, we will now move onward to the assault,"
and Custer touched his spurs to his steed.</p>

<p>A few notes from the trumpeters, and the regiment
was again in motion.</p>

<p>Onward at a gallop went the troops.</p>

<p>The valley of the Little Horn was reached, and
where the great trail entered it, another halt was
made.</p>

<p>Now the immense village was in sight: large
bands of warriors made their appearance on all
sides, some of them mounted, others on foot.</p>

<p>That there was serious business before them
every man in that regiment saw by intuition;
bloody work that would ring from one end of the
land to the other, and yet how few of them suspected
in what a terrible way it would end.</p>

<p>Custer was reckless; every military man has
agreed upon that.</p>

<p>He possessed a willful trait in his character that
at times showed itself, and when the occasion presented,
as it was fated to do before this day was
over, merged into an indomitable stubborn
nature. This one serious fault was generally hidden
beneath his dashing spirit, and it would be a
difficult thing to have met a more social companion
than this hero of the last Indian war.</p>

<p>There was something wrong about him on this
day when he committed his fatal error.</p>

<p>United in a solid body, the regiment might have
cut its way through the Indian camp, and in the
end come out victorious.</p>

<p>Custer either considered his force stronger than
it really was, or else underestimated the fighting
powers of the enemy.</p>

<p>He was too confident, and, in order that the
Indians should not escape, ordered Major Reno,
with three companies, to enter the valley where
the trail struck it.</p>

<p>The yellow-haired cavalry leader took five companies
himself, numbering over three hundred
men, with the avowed intention of entering the
village some three miles further down.</p>

<p>Major Reno could offer no remonstrance to his
superior officer, although perhaps he may have
felt that this plan was a most dangerous one.</p>

<p>His lips and those of his fellow officers were
sealed by military discipline. Not so, however,
with Pandy Ellis.</p>

<p>He had gazed upon the tremendous Indian
village as it could be seen from their elevated
position with something akin to amazement.
Never before in all its vast experience had the
veteran ranger witnessed such a gathering of redskins,
and his usually smiling face clouded with
apprehension.</p>

<p>None knew the reckless, dashing nature of
Custer better than Pandy, and he heard the
orders for a division of the regiment with dismay.</p>

<p>He even ventured to remonstrate with the general,
but the latter turned upon him fiercely, and,
although his sudden anger suddenly cooled down
without a word being spoken, the look was
enough to inform the ranger that he was meddling
with affairs in which he had no part.</p>

<p>All the censure of the rash act must fall upon
one pair of shoulders, where the glory also rests.</p>

<p>Pandy fell a little behind when the detachment
struck off behind the crest of the high bluffs
marking the right bank of the Little Big Horn.
The old fellow had grown more cautious in his
advancing years, and although at one time, in his
career, this daring assault would have filled him
with thoughts of glory, it now had an effect quite
the reverse. He could only deplore the fact that
Custer would take no warning, but persisted in
riding directly into the jaws of death. Duty
seemed to stand out before the ranger, and dashing
alongside the general, he once more begged
him to consider the situation. Something was
certainly wrong with the usually gentlemanly
general.</p>

<p>"Old friend," said he, "if you fear for your own
safety, there is plenty of time to join Reno
yonder. If for my welfare, I beg of you to let the
subject drop."</p>

<p>"General, if 'twar any other man az sed that,
he shud never live ter see another sunrise. Ye
know Pandy Ellis better than that," said the old
man, reproachfully. Custer moved uneasily in
his saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me, Ellis; I meant nothing. Some
devilish humor seems to possess me to-day, and I
must let it out in fight. Besides, there is no
danger."</p>

<p>"No danger!" muttered Pandy, falling back
again, "no danger. Cuss me ef thet don't sound
odd. Three hundred agin three thousand!
Taint like ther old days now; then reds war reds,
but now az they've got rifles and kin use 'em
better than our men, ther devils. Lord forgive
me, but I must say that I never hearn o' sich a
reckless thing. Pandy Ellis air a goin' ter see
it through, though, ef he does go under. Time's
'bout nigh up anyhow, might az well larf an' grow
fat, az ther feller sez. Don't think o' Bolly, but
jist yell an' sail in. Hooray!" and the ranger
gave a subdued shout as the wild excitement
seized upon him.</p>

<p>Major Reno was left behind with his three
companies. Further to the left, some two miles
away, was Captain Belton with three more companies.</p>

<p>As Custer and his ill-fated three hundred rode
gallantly away, vanishing behind the crown of
the bluffs, some of those who remained may
have entertained suspicions of the dreadful result
that was soon to follow, but no time was granted
to realize what these conjectures amounted to.</p>

<p>The Indians had gathered thickly on the opposite
bank, and Major Reno at once gave the word
to go forward.</p>

<p>Fording the river in the midst of a fire so deadly
that several saddles were emptied, the soldiers
reached the other shore. Once on <i>terra firma</i>
they formed and then charged.</p>

<p>As the bugles rang out it was a glorious sight
to see that compact body of men dash forward
like an avalanche, clearing the way before them
as if they were invincible.</p>

<p>Alas! that such a gallant charge should have
been in vain.</p>

<p>Overwhelming numbers opposed the troops;
the horses could not even move forward, and,
brave to the core, the men threw themselves to
the ground and fought on foot. It was a terrible
struggle, but could not last long.</p>

<p>Finding that the number of the Indians was
far more than had been even imagined, and realizing
that to continue the struggle would mean
the sacrifice of every man in the command, Major
Reno reluctantly gave the order to remount, and
the three companies crossed the river again under
a harassing fire, sadly depleted in number.</p>

<p>Just then Captain Belton came up with his
men, but seeing the madness of attempting to
assail the infuriated horde of red demons, savage
at their success and the sight of blood, he wisely
retired, and joined Reno, who had taken up a
position on one of the bluffs back of the river
bank.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
&mdash;<i>Charge of the Light Brigade.</i><br />
</p>


<p>The Crimean war may have presented its
phases of reckless daring to the world, but I
doubt if such a case as Custer's gallop to glory
and death has been paralleled since the days of
Leonidas and his deathless Spartans in the world-famed
pass of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>They literally rode to destruction, as may be
seen when it is officially stated that not one regular
soldier in the whole command lived through
the battle.</p>

<p>After leaving the attack at the upper end of the
village to Reno's case, Custer and his men struck
along the route selected, at as rapid a pace as the
nature of the ground permitted.</p>

<p>This line of travel was just beyond the crest of
the high bluffs, and no doubt the leading principle
that actuated the general into selecting it,
was an idea that their movements might be concealed
from the enemy.</p>

<p>In this, however, the project failed utterly, for
great numbers of Indian scouts had posted themselves
on the crags and their rifles kept up a continued
musical refrain far from pleasant to the
ears of the devoted band, more than one of whom
threw up his arms and fell from his steed as the
bitter lead cut home.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous ride, and yet in the face
of this murderous fire these valiant men rode on,
turning neither to the right nor the left, but keeping
straight forward.</p>

<p>Now and then a trooper, exasperated beyond
endurance by the fall of some dear comrade,
would discharge his carbine at the Indians who
showed themselves boldly on one side.</p>

<p>Owing to the rapid motion these shots were indifferently
rewarded, only a few of the most expert
hitting the objects of their aim.</p>

<p>On ordinary occasions old Pandy Ellis would
have been one of the first to prove his markmanship,
but something seemed to keep his attention
riveted in one direction, and amidst the storm of
hissing bullets, growing momentarily louder and
more threatening, the prairie ranger rode as
calmly as if indeed there was no danger.</p>

<p>But if our old friend paid little attention to this
deadly discharge from all quarters, others made
up for his lack of interest, and growls of dissatisfaction
arose on all sides; not at their leader, but
because it was almost impossible to return the
fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>With his usual disregard for danger, Custer
rode in the advance, where his form was a prominent
mark for all concealed sharp-shooters; but
the general, in spite of all, seemed to bear a
charmed life.</p>

<p>He leaned forward in the saddle, and seemed
to be scrutinizing some point of land, toward
which his attention had been drawn by Bloody-Knife,
one of his Crow scouts.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, after a gallop of nearly
three miles after leaving Major Reno, that Custer
gave a start and uttered an exclamation as a bullet
grazed his flesh, making a slight but burning
skin wound.</p>

<p>Aroused to action by this, his quick eye took in
all the surroundings, and immediately the order
was given to change the route.</p>

<p>Passing over the crown of the bluffs, the cavalry
rushed down toward where the Little Big
Horn ran noisily over its bed.</p>

<p>Indians seemed as thick as blackberries on a
July day.</p>

<p>From every bush and rock they made their appearance,
ugly-looking and determined on mischief.</p>

<p>All the way down to the level bank of the river
men kept dropping, and with them horses, but in
spite of it all the brave squad kept straight on.</p>

<p>Just at this moment a new form appeared
among the blue coats.</p>

<p>Where he came from no one had the slightest
idea, not even keen-eyed Pandy himself.</p>

<p>The first the ranger knew of it, he saw some
one mounted on a white horse dash by him, and
a boy dressed in the becoming suit of a hunter
drew rein beside the yellow-haired chief.</p>

<p>Custer turned his head for the first time since
changing the course of his troop, and his face expressed
evident displeasure when he saw the boy.</p>

<p>"Mason, boy, you here?" the officer ejaculated.</p>

<p>The young fellow did not seem to pay any heed
to the dismay that was plainly perceptible in the
tones of the general.</p>

<p>"General," he almost shouted, putting out a
hand to seize Custer's bridle, but which was impatiently
put away by him, "to go forward is
impossible. They are ten to your one."</p>

<p>"To retreat is also impossible, even if we wished
it," said Custer, grimly.</p>

<p>It was indeed so; the command could never
scale the bluffs again in the face of those defending
them.</p>

<p>Again the boy appealed.</p>

<p>"General, the whole river bank is a mass of
reds. It is a trap, an ambuscade. Turn back, or
halt, if you value your life," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Several of the officers were waiting for a reply;
but Custer, firm and brave to the last, did
not hesitate in his course.</p>

<p>He realized that a terrible error had been committed
in dividing his troop; but he possessed
the spirit to persist in his former plan, hoping to
come out all right in the end.</p>

<p>His fellow officers saw the lips pressed firmly
together.</p>

<p>Then came the one word:</p>

<p>"Forward!"</p>

<p>The foot of the bluffs was reached, and then
the truth of the boy's assertion became manifest.</p>

<p>Another moment, and the gallant command
was completely surrounded by a struggling, yelling
mass of Indians, many of whom were
mounted.</p>

<p>Then commenced the deadliest fight that has
ever been known to take place on the plains.</p>

<p>All the attendant noises of a great battle, cannon
excepted, could be found here.</p>

<p>The Sioux seemed crazy with both anger and
delight; and many a poor fellow, struggling hard
in the midst of this sea of humanity, was actually
pulled from his horse into the arms of death.</p>

<p>There was no halt made at all.</p>

<p>The command kept compactly together, using
their weapons as best they could, but never thinking
of retreating.</p>

<p>On, on, was the cry; forward, the shout.</p>

<p>Being prevented from fording the river by the
overwhelming force, Custer and his men rode
along the shore.</p>

<p>Every second the number of opponents swelled,
as those upon the heights came down upon the
scene of action; and still the little band went on,
trampling down and riding over those who would
not get out of the way.</p>

<p>As a single man in a crowd is pushed hither
and thither, like a feather floating on the water
and at the mercy of the wind, so Custer and his
command were drawn away from the river.</p>

<p>Everywhere was their trail marked by the dead,
until it came to the slaughter-pen.</p>

<p>After leaving the water, the remnant of the gallant
Seventh attempted to make a break out of
this infuriated mass, but the tide had set in
against them.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes of this awful fighting, and
then there came a time when retreat was utterly
out of the question, much as they might have
wished it. The Sioux had forced them into a
ravine, and here was enacted the closing scene of
the bloody drama.</p>

<p>Custer saw the inevitable finale; hope of a rescue
there could be none, as Reno had received
positive orders, and Terry and Crook were far
away in different directions.</p>

<p>In this ravine they must die, then.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Custer, "we are trapped
like foxes. To stay here means death. Forward,
men, forward. Down with the hounds!"</p>

<p>Wounds counted as nothing at this dread moment;
so long as a man could keep his seat, he
was in good luck; it was the death bullet that
told.</p>

<p>"My Heavens! the general's shot!" shouted a
soldier close to Pandy Ellis.</p>

<p>Custer was reeling in his saddle; the film of
death already showed itself in those clear eyes,
but bracing himself, he discharged his revolver
full in the face of Black Sculley, the renegade,
who had given him his death-wound.</p>

<p>The scoundrel rolled over with a curse; Custer's
last shot had done its work.</p>

<p>As the general fell from his saddle he was
caught in the arms of the boy hunter, who had
dismounted.</p>

<p>While the awful din raged around, and men
were covering one another with blood, the soul
of as gallant an officer as ever drew sword passed
away to a better world.</p>

<p>Custer died at the head of his command.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW THE COMMAND PAID FOR IMMORTALITY.</p>


<p>Their valiant leader lying dead upon the
ground, and men continually dropping on all
sides, the remnant of the officers saw that the
game was up. There was not one chance in a
thousand for their escape, and the only thing
that was left to them was to fight to the last
gasp, to "pile the field with Moslem slain," and
die as did Bowie and his friends at the Alamo,
with the bodies of their enemies forming a
breast-high bulwark around them.</p>

<p>"Down with the redfiends!"</p>

<p>It was brave Colonel Cook's last words, for
hardly had he spoken before a lance knocked
the red sword from his hand. Eager hands
seemed to clutch at him on all sides, and in an
instant he had disappeared, being pulled down
among that surging crowd of savage devils.</p>

<p>Colonel Custer fought like a Hercules, but
nothing could avail against such overwhelming
numbers. In the confusion of the onslaught he
had accidentally become separated a little from
the rest, and although this may have hastened his
death a trifle, in the end it made no difference.
This gallant man was the next officer to fall.
His horse was shot under him, and almost before
he had reached the ground fate had overtaken
him.</p>

<p>His comrade, Colonel Yates, uttered a heavy
groan when Custer fell, and as if yet hoping
against hope, turned his eyes towards the bluffs
above. For once the brave man found himself
wishing a fellow officer would commit a breach
of discipline, and disobey orders. If Reno came
up with the remaining seven companies they
might be saved. Alas! the major never came,
for about this time he was industriously engaged
in defending himself against a horde of savage
Sioux.</p>

<p>As moment after moment glided away, every
spark of hope left the heart of Yates, and clenching
his teeth, he turned his full attention upon
the scene around him.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was enough to appall the stoutest
heart to see that little band of brave men hemmed
in on all sides by a surging mass of red demons,
each one of whom seemed to feel the old desire
for human blood so characteristic of the Indian
race.</p>

<p>It would have been a sight fit for a painter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
yet what artist could do justice to the expression
of mingled despair and courage that showed
itself upon each face in that noble little band?</p>

<p>Ah, me! It was a terrible, terrible half-hour.
Men in that gallant Seventh, who had been ordinary
mortals before, now proved themselves heroes,
and fought like tigers at bay.</p>

<p>There is something fearful in the look of a man
who has given up every vestige of hope, and
fights with that fierce courage born of despair;
one can never expect to see it elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Boys, we've got to die here. Close up and
let every man take half a dozen of these red
fiends to eternity with him."</p>

<p>It was Captain Smith who yelled this out, and
those who knew him best can believe it of the
officer.</p>

<p>This was not his first Indian fight.</p>

<p>He had faced death before, but never would
again.</p>

<p>Bronzed, bearded faces grew paler than usual,
and perhaps some hands shook as the men
thought of the loved ones at home.</p>

<p>God knows that they had cause to feel this
weakness for a moment, when they realized that
never again should their eyes behold those dear
friends, and that this ravine in which they fought
was doomed to be their field of death.</p>

<p>"Keep your faces towards the foe!" shouted
Colonel Yates, bravely, and to himself he muttered
the anxious prayer that could never be answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens! that Crook was here, or Andy
Burt and the Ninth."</p>

<p>But Crook and Gallant Major Burt were far
away.</p>

<p>The Indians, incited by their chiefs, now prepared
for a grand final rush.</p>

<p>Mr. Read, who had accompanied the expedition,
was down; Colonel Keogh had vanished a
long time before, and just at this critical juncture
Captain Smith threw up his arms, and after reeling
for an instant in his saddle, slipped to the
ground.</p>

<p>Yates saw that the closing scene was at hand.</p>

<p>"Close up, men, close up! For God's sake, let
every man keep his face towards them! The old
Seventh will become famous!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, famous at the dear cost of the utter
extermination of almost half its number.</p>

<p>A yell, such as might have made the earth
tremble, and the whole mass of warriors, mounted
and on foot, came against the solid little phalanx
like an avalanche.</p>

<p>Had the rush been from one quarter alone, the
remnant of cavalry would have been swept out of
existence like a flash, scattered here and there
among their enemies; but as the press came from
all sides at once, it only served to crush them
closer together.</p>

<p>In union there is always strength.</p>

<p>Had the hundred cavalrymen now left been
divided into small groups, they would have been
all killed before ten minutes had passed by, but in
a solid body they could resist for over half an
hour.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis was in the thick of it.</p>

<p>His blood was thoroughly aroused, and I doubt
if any man in that ill-fated command killed half as
many red-skins as did this gray-haired ranger.</p>

<p>When his rifle and pistols were empty, he
slung the former to his back very coolly, and
then, drawing the huge bowie-knife that had
given him the name of Heavy Knife, he sailed
in to conquer or die. Experienced in these matters,
he had foreseen such a catastrophe, although
even his vivid imagination had failed to paint
such a serious calamity.</p>

<p>Pandy had expected to be forced into a retreat,
but such a thing as having the whole command
utterly annihilated never entered his head, until
they were pushed into the ravine trap.</p>

<p>Even when he was fighting in the midst of the
red-skins, a thought of the strange boy who had
so suddenly disappeared among them, entered
his head.</p>

<p>Custer had called him Mason, and seemed to
feel some affection for him.</p>

<p>Pandy's eyes soon fell upon him. He had the
general's revolver in his hand, and was seated on
his horse, engaged in emptying it with commendable
precision, making every shot tell.</p>

<p>When the ranger looked again, a few moments
later, the boy had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Poor feller, he's done fur; an' yet it'll likely
be ther fate o' us all," muttered Pandy, as he
drove his keen blade home in the broad breast of
a brave.</p>

<p>At such a dread time as this the eye of a participant
could not take in the entire scene.</p>

<p>All that Pandy was sure of after Cooke fell
pierced by many wounds, was that every member
of that heroic band fought as if the strength
and endurance of a dozen men was in his body.</p>

<p>For every blue-coat who fell, at least two Indians
bit the dust.</p>

<p>Although the fight had grown more silent, now
that nearly all the firearms were discharged, it
was none the less deadly on that account.</p>

<p>Sabers, red with human gore, were flashed in
the sun's bright rays, and urged to their deadly
work by arms that seemed iron in their endurance.</p>

<p>Lances, tomahawks and keen knives opposed
them, and now and then a rifle added its weight
to the side of the Indians.</p>

<p>On each occasion, some poor fellow would totter
in his saddle, and finding himself going, show
the spirit that imbued his nature by making a
last sweeping blow at the enemy who held such
a tight grip on them all.</p>

<p>It was horrible to see how that devoted little
band continually diminished in numbers.</p>

<p>There were hardly forty left now, and in ten
minutes these had become less than twenty. The
end was near at hand.</p>

<p>Yates still lived, although the only commissioned
officer.</p>

<p>His face was very white, and streaked with
blood, so that old Pandy, still fighting like a hero,
hardly recognized the man who touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Old friend, try to escape and carry the news
to Crook and Reno. If you succeed, tell them to
let my folks know how I died, and that my last
were of them. The old seventh has made a
record that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was never finished; the fatal bullet came,
and as brave a man as ever presented his face to
the foe succumbed to the inevitable.</p>

<p>Pandy seemed to hesitate an instant, then his
powder-begrimed face lit up.</p>

<p>"I'll do it, bust my buttons. Might az wal die
tryin' it az hyar. Good-bye, boys; I'm in fur
death, or ter carry ther news ter Crook. Nancy,
away wid ye," and the knife point sent the animal
bounding among the Indians.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later and all was over. The ravine
looked like a slaughter-pen in the daylight,
and even when the Sioux, glutted with blood,
searched among the heaps of slain for any who
might live, the sun sank out of sight as if ashamed
to look upon such a horrid scene, and a merciful
darkness hurried to close over the ravine of
death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BOLLY WHERRIT'S BATTLE ON A SMALL SCALE.</p>


<p>When Bolly Wherrit threw himself upon the
guard at his prison lodge, he was without a single
weapon.</p>

<p>Besides this his hands and wrists were considerably
lacerated by the cruel glass that had
been the means of his gaining freedom, but he
had no doubt regarding his ability to overcome
the fellow, especially as he had the advantage of
a surprise.</p>

<p>Finding himself so suddenly seized by the
throat, the guard turned like a flash and attempted
to use his arm, thinking to get the hunter in a
bear's clasp, and then hold him till assistance
came.</p>

<p>He counted without his host, however, as many
folks are in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>Raised in the school of nature, very nearly the
whole of his life being spent upon the plains in
active warfare with the savage denizens thereof,
it was not likely that Bolly would in his declining
years lose the prompt discretion and agility that
had marked his whole checkered career.</p>

<p>Perhaps that Indian thought a thunderbolt had
seized hold of him, that is, if he took time to
think at all, which is rather questionable, and in
truth he would not have been far from the
truth.</p>

<p>The way in which Bolly shook him by means
of the hold upon his throat would have reminded
one of a terrier and a rat.</p>

<p>So violent was the motion that the unlucky fellow's
head was in danger of coming off, and when
Bolly in the end dashed his clenched fist full in
the red face, it ended the matter, for when he released
his clasp the man dropped to the ground
perfectly insensible.</p>

<p>To stoop over the fallen brave and transfer the
fellow's weapon to his own person, was, for the
ranger, but the work of a moment.</p>

<p>Quite a fine-looking rifle, of a modern pattern,
a long, ugly-looking knife, a revolver and some
ammunition were thus appropriated without compunction,
for Bolly believed in the adage that "to
the victor belong the spoils." Besides, had not
this man or his friends made themselves owners
of his articles of warfare without saying so much
as "by your leave."</p>

<p>There were very few men left in the village;
for one to remain idle when such deadly work
was in progress at two separate points would
have been a decided disgrace.</p>

<p>A dozen cavalrymen dashing in at the northern
and western end of the village could have carried
everything before them.</p>

<p>Not forty yards away from the prison lodge,
some ten or twelve warriors were clustered, being
wounded braves unable to take part in the
great battle.</p>

<p>So interested were these worthies in what was
passing before their eyes (for, standing on a little
elevation, they could see the fight with Reno now
drawing to an end, and the gallop to death of
brave Custer and his men), that the little episode
in their rear did not serve to attract their attention.</p>

<p>It was only when the ranger arose to his feet,
after arming himself by means of the late guard's
weapons, that one of the wounded braves happened
to catch sight of him, and, giving the alarm
to his companions, the whole of them started forward
with a yell.</p>

<p>If they were to be deprived of a share in both
of the fierce battles, why could they not get up
a little affair of their own, a private entertainment,
so to speak, whereby each individual
participant on their side might share the excitement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them Bolly Wherrit proved
too willing, and then again he wanted all the fun
on his side of the house.</p>

<p>"Now fur sumpin rich. Calculate I kin wipe
out them reds like a chalk mark. Old bruiser in
front thar, take keer o' yerself."</p>

<p>The rifle proved to be a good one in the right
hands, for as the report sounded, one of the approaching
braves sprang wildly forward with a
convulsive drawing up of the legs, and was met
half way by death.</p>

<p>Then the revolver commenced its fearful
work.</p>

<p>As man after man lay down never to rise
again, Bolly burst out into a wild, reckless
laugh.</p>

<p>When the chambers were empty, only four men
stood erect, and they looked as if they wished
themselves anywhere but in their present situation.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted by the force of numbers, Bolly
sprang towards them, holding his empty rifle in
one hand and the long knife in the other.</p>

<p>Some stern duty appeared to call these four
brave fellows in as many different directions,
just then; at any rate they did not wait for the
arrival of White Thunder, but dashed wildly
away, forgetful alike of their wounded dignity,
and their late dignified wounds. A shout from
the old hunter caused them to expedite matters,
and Bolly laughed at the ludicrous figures they
cut.</p>

<p>A shrill neigh close by caused him to start. It
was a well-remembered sound, and the hunter
quickly turned his face in the direction from
whence it came.</p>

<p>A horse, saddled and bridled, was fastened to
a stake driven into the ground in front of a tent,
and Bolly saw that it was his own lost steed. The
animal had recognized its master, and had given
token of its love for him.</p>

<p>With a few bounds Bolly was at the side of
Black Bess.</p>

<p>As his hand fell caressingly upon the noble
mare's mane, the skin serving as a door to the
lodge was swept suddenly aside, and the next
instant Bolly found himself face to face with
Blue Horse, a noted chief, and an old enemy of
his.</p>

<p>What this individual was doing in his lodge
while his comrades fought and bled will, perhaps,
never be known, and does not really affect
the course of my narrative.</p>

<p>All that I wish to be positive about is the fact
that he was there, and that for almost fully sixty
seconds the foes glared at each other.</p>

<p>"Ugh! White Thunder! Blue Horse no forget
ears," grunted the chief, as he put his hand
to his belt and drew a revolver.</p>

<p>"Remember that ole scrimmage, eh, chief?
Wal, I reckon I cud give ye another leetle reminder
o' this happy occasion, seein' that yer is
so partic'lar 'bout it," and the ranger laughed in
the Indian's face.</p>

<p>Blue Horse angrily raised his weapon, but considerately
refrained from firing. The reason of
this clemency on his part was obvious.</p>

<p>Bolly held his empty revolver in his hand, and
this had been thrown with tremendous force
against the chief's head, which, not being made
of iron, gave way, and the Sioux nation had to
mourn the loss of another leader.</p>

<p>Bolly secured the revolver of Blue Horse, and
was thinking of searching the village from one
end to the other in order to accomplish the strange
mission that had brought him to this part of the
country, when a chorus of angry yells attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>Upon investigation these were found to proceed
from a score of mounted red men who were
dashing along towards him, having evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
been attracted by the cries of the four wounded
warriors, who had fled after their little private
amusement.</p>

<p>"Plague take the luck, I must git. Sich a good
chance thrown away. Now, ye kin bet high on't,
Bolly Wherrit's goin' ter have his own rifle back
agin, an' resky that gal mighty soon. Whoa,
Bess, whoa, old girl. Have they been treatin' ye
bad? Away now, an' make the dust fly!"</p>

<p>Faithful Black Bess needed no second invitation,
but darted away like an arrow shot from
the bow, with Bolly swinging his rifle in the air,
and shouting defiance to those who followed
after.</p>

<p>His first thought was to make for the river and
join the combatants on the other shore, but upon
glancing across, such a mass of surging humanity
met his gaze that Bolly was actually appalled.
Besides, his pursuers were between himself and
the water having come from that direction.</p>

<p>"Tarnal death! but it looks hot over thar.
Reckon it must be Custer, for I swar no other
man wud do sich a dare-devil thing. Ef they
get outer thet hole, then I'll guv the general
credit fur a heap o' smartness. Oh! yer imps o'
Satan. 'Spect ter ketch me, hey? Wal, now we'll
see what the hoss has ter say 'bout thet," muttered
Bolly.</p>

<p>Actions often speak louder than words; if
Black Bess could not talk, she certainly showed
what she thought of the case by making a streak
that promised to carry the ranger out of sight
very shortly.</p>

<p>The last the score of Sioux saw of him he was
waving his old hat in an affectionate farewell,
and the exuberant shouts he gave utterance to
came faintly across the level ground.</p>

<p>Bolly made at once for the hills, which he
reached in a short time. Here we will leave the
brave old ranger for a time, hatching up daring
plans to carry out his singular mission, and return
once more to that ravine of death where
Custer and the last of his command fell beneath
the fury of the Sioux and their renegade friends.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ROBBERS OF THE DEAD.</p>


<p>Night had closed over the scene of the terrible
battle, but the darkness was not intense, as the
stars shone out with unusual brilliancy, and
the silver crescent of a new moon in the western
sky lent its feeble aid.</p>

<p>The cold stars looked down upon a fearful
sight; such an one as has not been seen in this
fair land for many a year.</p>

<p>Hundreds of men and horses lying dead in that
fatal ravine, and a trail of bodies leading almost
in a circle, down to the river and then up the
bluffs.</p>

<p>Valiant men lay here: heroes whose names
shall ever be mentioned with proud honor by their
surviving comrades; and yet what a price they
paid for that worthless commodity to the dead&mdash;immortality.</p>

<p>Across the Little Horn could be heard the
noises of a great camp, and once in a while the
breeze bore the distant crack of firearms.</p>

<p>These last came from several miles to the
south, where Major Reno had intrenched his
command on the bluffs, and from hastily-constructed
rifle-pits fought the enemy, who had
posted themselves on the neighboring heights,
where they could control his position.</p>

<p>Shadowy figures glided hither and thither over
the field of battle, for that it was a battle, though
a very uneven one, I do affirm, in spite of the
constant appellation of massacre indulged in by
the newspaper men.</p>

<p>The very word massacre brings to mind the
idea of a wholesale butchery of helpless people.
Historians are prone to be partial in its use.</p>

<p>We always find the affair termed a massacre
when the Indians are victorious; but when the
tables are turned it is "a splendid campaign," "a
hard-fought battle," and "a glorious victory for
the troops."</p>

<p>If the word massacre does not mean a one-sided
butchery, then every world's battle has
been such.</p>

<p>As to Custer's particular case, did he not move
forward with the intention of attacking the village,
and though every man fell, did they not
slay at least their own number of redskins?
Then this proves the affair a battle and not a
massacre.</p>

<p>Having carried my point, I beg pardon for the
digression.</p>

<p>These shadowy figures gliding over the scene
of death were robbers of the slain, and having no
compunctions of conscience, if a coveted ring refused
to come off, the finger was at once severed
in order to obtain the bauble.</p>

<p>Noble Custer and most of his officers lay close
together, just as they had fallen.</p>

<p>Near by was a heap of slain, which included
troopers, Sioux and horses.</p>

<p>One of the robbers of the dead approached this
pile, and began pulling the bodies about in a promiscuous
manner, his eyes busily engaged
searching for plunder.</p>

<p>Under this pile a form lay, which, as the heavenly
lights fell upon it, revealed the features of
the boy who had been beside General Custer
when he fell.</p>

<p>Something gleamed from the little finger of his
left hand, and as this sparkled in the light of the
moon, the prowler uttered a delighted exclamation
that at once proved him to be a white man.</p>

<p>Seizing hold of the hand, he at once attempted
to pull the diamond solitaire ring off, but this
proving fruitless, he felt for his knife.</p>

<p>Just as this was drawn, his hand was tightly
clutched by the one he held.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was, that the boy had
been rendered insensible by being struck with a
bullet, that glanced from his forehead without
breaking the bone.</p>

<p>Others, killed later in the desperate struggle,
had fallen upon him, and here for several hours
he lay at the door of death.</p>

<p>When the heap that pressed upon him had been
removed by the robber, the fresh air served to
partially revive him, and the twisting of his finger
by the desperado finished the business.</p>

<p>Mason, as I shall call my boy hero, for Custer
had given him that name when addressing him,
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>By the dim light of the stars and the new moon
combined, he saw the figure of a man kneeling
over him.</p>

<p>That it was a white man was evident from his
clothes and hat, and also the bushy beard.</p>

<p>A pair of fine cavalry boots, stolen from some
unfortunate officer, were slung across his shoulders,
and he seemed burdened down with all sorts
of plunder.</p>

<p>Mason waited to see no more.</p>

<p>The wrenching at his finger ceased, the man
uttered a curse, and began to draw his knife.</p>

<p>Then the whole horrible truth burst upon the
boy's mind.</p>

<p>Under the impulse of the moment he tightened
his clasp, and actually pulled himself to his feet
by means of the renegade, and after this had been
accomplished, released his hold.</p>

<p>The matter did not rest here.</p>

<p>Amazed at having the dead come to life in such
an unexpected manner, as it seemed, the renegade
uttered a cry and started back.</p>

<p>Custer's revolver was still held in the boy's right
hand, just as it had been when he had fallen to
the earth.</p>

<p>Whether a single load remained or not he could
not tell, but quickly pulling up the hammer he
raised the weapon.</p>

<p>When the robber of the dead, base craven that
he was, saw this movement, he flung out his
hands in an involuntary appeal for mercy, but
the boy, after passing through such a bitter,
bloody experience, could feel no pity for such as
he.</p>

<p>The hammer fell, the crack came, and the bullet
did its mission of retributive justice.</p>

<p>"My God! I'm done for. Curses on the young
hound," half howled the renegade, reeling wildly
in the effort to keep his feet, and at length plunging
to the ground, where he lay covered with
plunder, waiting for some other robber to relieve
him as he had despoiled others.</p>

<p>Mason sank to the ground immediately, and it
was not until several moments had passed by that
he ventured to raise his head and look around.</p>

<p>Not an object was stirring near him.</p>

<p>If the marauders of the dead had noticed the
shot at all, they had taken it for granted that it
was fired by one of their number at a wounded
cavalryman, and the shout given by the victim of
the bullet went far to corroborate this idea.</p>

<p>As he looked, Mason saw one of those shadowy
forms skulking about and bending over the dead.</p>

<p>Fearful lest he should meet with one such and
be murdered for want of weapons, he crawled
over to where the renegade lay and secured his
revolver.</p>

<p>Not content with this, he quietly proceeded to
reload the empty chambers of the one he had
taken from the holsters of Custer's saddle.</p>

<p>When this was done, he felt content, and arose
to his feet.</p>

<p>Although he could see in the immediate vicinity,
all appeared dark and gloomy a hundred
yards away, and the bluffs could only be distinguished
because they were outlined against the
star-bedecked sky after the manner of a silhouette.</p>

<p>Which way to go was a puzzler.</p>

<p>Beyond the ravine he could hear the murmur
of the river, and knew that on the other shore
was the camp of the Sioux.</p>

<p>Once clear of this slaughter-pen and his ideas
would flow more naturally, for it was impossible
to think calmly while the mutilated bodies of
friends lay around on every side.</p>

<p>To say a thing was to do it with Custer's boy
friend.</p>

<p>He seemed to know that the general must be
near by, and was led instinctively to his body.</p>

<p>A horse had fallen upon Custer's lower limbs,
but the heavy weight had given him no pain, for
he had been beyond that when the animal was
shot.</p>

<p>I cannot positively say that the tears came from
the boy's eyes, as some of my readers might
deem that an unmanly proceeding, though God
knows the poor fellow had cause enough to weep,
with his best and only friend lying dead before
him.</p>

<p>That he lifted the general's cold hand and
kissed it repeatedly, while murmuring a farewell,
I can and do affirm.</p>

<p>A moment more and he was stealthily making
his way along the ravine, heading toward the
river.</p>

<p>A vague notion that a horse was necessary to
his future movements had intruded itself upon
his brain, and although his plan of obtaining one
was as yet illy defined, it constantly gained
ground.</p>

<p>Once a dark form suddenly rose up in front of
him, but the greasy Indian got no further than
the drawing of his knife, when Mason's revolver
sounded his death note, and without even a groan
he sank beside the dead man whom he had been
in the act of despoiling when disturbed by the
boy's approach.</p>

<p>Avoiding all others whom he saw, Mason soon
left the ravine behind him, and passing over the
intervening ground, where a few bodies were
scattered promiscuously about, he stood upon
the river bank.</p>

<p>There was something soothing in the steady
hum of the water which appeared to steady the
boy's disturbed mind, and for almost half an
hour he stood leaning against a tree that bent over
the river, and engaged in dreamy fancies.</p>

<p>He had almost forgotten his notion of getting
a remount in place of the one lost during the
bloody skirmish.</p>

<p>Sad thoughts had crowded into his mind.</p>

<p>Of all that gallant band, was he the only survivor?</p>

<p>It seemed so, indeed; but Mason did not know
of the supreme effort made by old Pandy Ellis,
the prince of bordermen.</p>

<p>The boy's reverie was becoming almost unbearable,
when it was disturbed by what appeared
to be the flash of a paddle further up the stream.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PANDY ELLIS' HOTTEST SCRIMMAGE.</p>


<p>Valliant old Pandy Ellis, the veteran ranger
of the prairies, was not the man to give up hope
easily. He had been in many a tight scrape before,
and had kept a bright face when the best of
men might have given up in despair.</p>

<p>But there was something so fearful in the horrible
struggle, where human efforts however
strong seemed puny as an infant's, that the
ranger might well be pardoned for shutting his
teeth grimly and resolving to die hard.</p>

<p>There were actually tears in his eyes as he
gave one last glance back at that sadly depleted
little band, where noble Yates still shouted out
encouraging words, and wielded his bloody
sword with an untiring arm.</p>

<p>It was the last ever seen of this detachment of
the gallant Seventh alive; and although the old
ranger were to live his whole life over again, he
could never forget that scene.</p>

<p>His hands were fully occupied in defending his
person against the many weapons raised against
it.</p>

<p>During the next five minutes Pandy had the
hottest little scrimmage that ever fell to his lot.</p>

<p>On every side nothing met his eye but a mass
of red faces, bearing the most devilish looks he
could imagine, and the owners of which were
trying their best to stab or shoot the rider.</p>

<p>Boldly he plunged into the thick of them.</p>

<p>Nancy trampled many under her feet, and bore
her inevitable wounds with the air of a martyr,
than which she could not well do otherwise, belonging
as she did to such a renowned hero.</p>

<p>Guns cracked about him, bullets whistled close
to his head, and cut into his flesh; lances, knives
and tomahawks were thrust up at him with
vengeful intent, and yet this veteran urged his
horse forward, armed only with a knife as a serviceable
weapon, with which he seemed to keep
himself surrounded by a wall of steel through
which it was next to impossible to force a passage.</p>

<p>How many men he and his horse killed between
them during that five minutes' fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
ride, Pandy could not even guess after it was
over, for his mind was in a whirl, and he did
mechanically the work that was needed, just as
a set machine might have done; but it must certainly
have been dozens.</p>

<p>Some men might have deemed it impossible to
force a way on horseback through that mass of
excited redskins. Colonel Yates had deemed it
so, but to Pandy nothing was accepted as beyond
the power to do, until an attempt had been made,
and Yates' last words to him proved that the
officer must have either placed more confidence
in the ranger's dash than his own, or else had
resolved to die with his brave boys at any risk.</p>

<p>It was over at last, this brief but exciting ride
of the prairie man's, encompassed on all quarters
by death.</p>

<p>As horse and rider burst out of that maddened
throng as a strong swimmer buffets the billows of
the mighty deep, Pandy drew a long breath.</p>

<p>Not that the danger was over by any means.
Here were dozens of Sioux braves outside of the
<i>melee</i>, and these seeing an enemy emerge from the
mass of struggling combatants, made a rush at
him. Pandy uttered a taunting laugh and dashed
away like a bird, for although Nancy was breathing
hard from her exertions, she was equal to
what the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>The ranger after clearing about a third of a
mile, turned to one side and rode up a pass that
led to the other side of the bluffs.</p>

<p>Reaching the crest, he passed along until almost
even with the ravine of death. Then he paused
for a last glimpse. Alas! all was over.</p>

<p>Yates too had fallen, and not one of his men
could be seen alive; all that was visible seemed to
be a sea of red men rushing pell-mell over the
battle-field.</p>

<p>Old Pandy was visibly affected.</p>

<p>"God help me! I never seen such a thing in my
life. The hull crowd wiped out az clean az a
whistle. What's goin' ter become o' us all at this
hyar rate. Custer, Cooke, Yates, Keogh, all gone.
Bust my buttons ef these reds ain't woke up wid
sum o' ther old fire. My hate fur 'em war dyin'
out, but it only needed this ter kindle it wus nor
ever. I'll have revenge for this day's work; Custer
shall never lie in his grave without satisfaction;
an' ef ther pesky Government won't take it
in hand, dash me, Bolly Wherrit's ther chap ter
stick by me. We'll go on ther war path, an' by
ther heavens above, if Sitting Bull don't pay dear
fur this, then it's because two ole trappers will
hev gone under. Tarnal Snakes an' critters! but
it makes me tearin' mad. I must let out my
spleen or bust; jist a parting card afore I go, ter
let 'em know what's comin' in ther future."</p>

<p>It took but a couple of moments to load his rifle
and revolvers.</p>

<p>His presence was not even suspected until the
gun sent its clear detonation echoing over the
hills.</p>

<p>A commotion was visible among the crowd below,
and cries of pain reached the ranger's ear
that were sweet music to him just then.</p>

<p>Without wasting any more time, he emptied all
the chambers of his revolver, and then turning
his horse's head, gave a loud hurrah, and vanished
from view, feeling a hundred per cent. better
after making a start in what he was pleased to
term his death roll.</p>

<p>Some thirty yards below the crest of the bluffs,
the way was easily traveled, and what few difficulties
presented themselves were speedily overcome
by such an enterprising individual as the
ranger.</p>

<p>In a short time Pandy came to Custer's back
trail.</p>

<p>It was quite deserted now, save by the dead,
for after the cavalry had passed, the Indians followed
after in order to have a hand in the battle
which they knew would take place when the
troops attempted to storm the village.</p>

<p>The crags that had so lately echoed with the
cracks of Indian rifles as their owners lay in ambush,
were silent now, and as Pandy rode along
he could not help thinking how different it would
have all been, had headstrong Custer cast aside
his willful mood, and listened to the advice of
one who had his best interest at heart.</p>

<p>It was while in this contemplative mood that
Pandy suddenly became aware of the fact that a
body of Indians were dodging about and among
the rocks in front of him.</p>

<p>To retreat was almost impossible, as he would
doubtless receive a bullet in the back.</p>

<p>Making what might be termed the best of a
bad bargain, Pandy took the bridle between his
teeth, and holding a revolver in each hand, urged
Nancy forward at a gallop.</p>

<p>There was something in the manner of this undaunted
man's facing death again after his recent
escape and great exertions, that would have enlisted
the admiration of even an enemy.</p>

<p>As he advanced, the redskins vanished altogether,
and Pandy was beginning to believe
they had gone altogether, when he heard a singular
but well-known whoop that made him draw
rein with an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>At the same instant a tall Indian stepped into
view from behind a bowlder and advanced boldly
toward the ranger.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to recognize him, for a smile
illuminated his bronzed and blood-stained countenance.</p>

<p>It was Eagle Eye, the Crow chief, whose hand
Pandy pressed so warmly.</p>

<p>The Crow scouts of the expedition were some
of his braves, but the chief had missed seeing the
ranger before.</p>

<p>They were old friends, having hunted and
trapped together a whole season several years
before.</p>

<p>"Brother been in the big fight; much hurt?"
said the chief, looking with dismay at the ranger's
many wounds, which he seemed to regard as so
many scratches, although some of them were
very serious.</p>

<p>"Yes, I war thar, chief, an' 'twar ther hottest
time o' my life. Did ye see it?"</p>

<p>"We reached the hilltop too late to take part.
Custer gone up and all his men? Ugh! it was a
heap big fight. How brother get away?"</p>

<p>"Wal, ye see," said Pandy, tying a rag over
one of his worst wounds, and sitting with one
leg over the saddle, "we war jist about goin'
under, an' I'd 'cluded not to survive the boys,
when Yates asked me ter make an attempt ter git
away ter carry the news ter Mary, az ther feller
sez, so I done it. Kin tell ye more about it another
time, chief. Just now I want ter git ye ter do
sumpin important. Know where Terry air?"</p>

<p>The chief pointed in the direction whence lay
the distant Yellowstone, as Pandy well knew, and
the ranger beamed his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I reckon ye're correct, chief. Now, what I
want is that ye send a couple o' yer men ter tell
the gineral this sad news, an' git him ter hurry on
hyar, fur I heerd firing down below, an' ef
Reno hain't met Custer's fate he's in a bad fix
anyhow. I intend ter jine him wharever he may
be an' stand ther consequences. Chief, I'm off.
Remember I depend on ye," and waving his
hand toward his red friend, Pandy Ellis disappeared
in the growing shadow that told of the
coming night.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">RED GOLIATH, THE GIGANTIC HERCULES.</p>


<p>Mason, General Custer's boy friend, leaned forward
still more, relying on the hold he had upon
the tree bending over the water, when that unmistakable
sound, the dip of a paddle, reached
his ears.</p>

<p>Underneath him the water of the Little Horn
gurgled and plashed among the stones jutting
out from the bank; close by a melancholy owl
tried to make night hideous with its solemn
declarations of warning, and once in a while the
barking of dogs in the great village could be
heard; but to these usual noises the boy paid
little heed, as he had heard them for some time
past.</p>

<p>The silver crescent still held forth in the western
sky, and its meager light, augmented by the
united force of stars, proved sufficient to see the
opposite shore of the river, which at this point
was rather narrow.</p>

<p>Could the boy's mental faculties have given him
warning that it was not a common foe he was
about to see?</p>

<p>There have been many occasions when persons
of fine perceptions and susceptibility have realized,
seemingly by tuition alone, that those whom
they bear no love for are in the vicinity.</p>

<p>With some people this delicate sense of knowing
what even the eyes and ears fail to tell becomes
an art.</p>

<p>Many a deaf and blind man can tell, even the
instant he enters the room, whether it be occupied
or not, no matter how quiet those within may
render themselves.</p>

<p>I only state this to defend my position when
saying that young Mason appeared to suspect
that a foe of more than common caliber was approaching.</p>

<p>Of course one cannot be positive as to what he
thought, but at any rate the boy leaned out further
than ever, and was fully engrossed in the
steady but light dip of the paddle.</p>

<p>Whoever this night traveler was, his movements
proclaimed him to be a man habitually addicted
to caution.</p>

<p>This the boy quickly discovered, for although
the canoe was undoubtedly approaching him, yet
the steady dips of the paddle seemed to grow
fainter if possible, or at least no louder.</p>

<p>Soon, by judging from the sounds he was enabled
to place the exact position of the descending
canoe, and a few seconds later a moving object
crossed his range of vision.</p>

<p>That this was a boat, and that this craft contained
but one person, soon became manifest as
it drew nearer the concealed watcher.</p>

<p>The man stood erect near the stern, and held
lightly poised in one hand the long paddle he had
just been using.</p>

<p>Even in the dim light one would think an ancient
giant, or at least a modern pocket edition of
the famous Goliath whom David, the shepherd
boy, slew with a stone, had appeared.</p>

<p>The colossal proportions reared themselves at
least seven feet high, and being bulky in proportion
the man presented a formidable aspect, such
as would at sight appall a common foe.</p>

<p>Mason uttered a low exclamation and gave a
companion start of surprise when the figure
loomed into view; but after this one indication of
his feelings he remained as motionless as a form
of bronze.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that person whom he
was now looking upon; even a casual glance
would have been sufficient to impress the face
and figure indelibly on any mind, and surely the
eyes of hate are more susceptible of retaining an
object they dislike than others.</p>

<p>Hate was a feeble word when used in connection
with the feeling our boy friend entertained
towards this giant in the canoe, and if there was
a word that combined fierce detestation, aversion,
and a bitter longing to hack a man to pieces, together
with a trifle of respect for his prowess, I
should use it; but every one knows how weak
the English language is in adjectives, compared
with the scorching Italian.</p>

<p>The giant's back was toward the bank where
Mason had concealed himself, and, judging from
his appearance, he was closely scrutinizing the
opposite shore as if intent on discovering something
that required time to reveal.</p>

<p>At this point the river was rather swift, owing
to its narrow bed, and his rapid motion seemed
to interfere sadly with his study of the other bank,
for he muttered several impatient words to himself
in a voice that made Mason grit his teeth like
a maniac when he heard it; for this verified what
suspicions the sight of the form had raised.</p>

<p>Downward came the canoe with the current,
and urged also by the impetus given by the last
few dips of the paddle.</p>

<p>It was within a dozen feet of the spot where
Mason hugged the tree-trunk, when the man
threw up an arm bare to the shoulder and as
knotty as the gnarled limb of an oak, and seized
upon a branch that bent affectionately toward the
cool water of the river. Instantly the canoe was
halted in its downward course, as if a wall of
stone had been suddenly reared in front of it, and
remained swinging to and fro, with the water
gurgling about the stern.</p>

<p>The giant now leaned down, and appeared to
look up and down the stream as if searching for
something.</p>

<p>This latter, which had been invisible to him
while descending the stream, proved the opposite
from his present post of observation, as the low
ejaculation of surprise manifested.</p>

<p>"There it is as I expected; one, two, three a
score of fires. The Indian village undoubtedly.
Now, there's work before you if you expect to
see that money, and such a sum ain't picked up
every day these times. I've seen it when I'd a
risked my life for a tenth of the gold. It's as
plain as daylight; after that battle and victory,
old Sitting Bull and his men 'll keep a loose
camp. All that I'm afraid of are those sharp
devils, Santee and Crazy Horse, for they've got
such a spite against me I'd have a nice time if
taken.</p>

<p>"Then I believe that Cheyenne chief, Black
Moccasin, is here, and he bears me a grudge for
that affair on the Platte.</p>

<p>"But what's the odds; I'm used to running
risks on a lone hand, and it's in me to win or lose
all. I'll cross here, leave the boat, and bring
back the gal, if I have to search every lodge in
the place," saying which the man let go of his
hold on the branches, and gave a sweep of his
paddle that startled the canoe towards the opposite
bank, which at this point was low and
sweeping.</p>

<p>Mason gave a convulsive movement when he
heard that word "gal" mentioned.</p>

<p>"It is Red Goliath, and he has come from <i>him</i>
for <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>These muttered words were all that he spoke;
after that his lips remained as close and immovable
as the clasps of a vise.</p>

<p>A few more sweeps of the paddle, almost noiselessly
given, served to bring the canoe to the opposite
shore, which the prow struck with a slight
grating sound.</p>

<p>Laying down the paddle, the giant leaped upon
the shore, and grasping the canoe pulled it upon
the pebbly bench so that it could not be carried
away by the action of the water.</p>

<p>As he turned around after doing this thing, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
dark shadowy form arose beside him, where it
had up to this time crouched in the obscurity.</p>

<p>Other ears than the boy's had heard the suspicious
dip of the paddle, and eyes that were
hostile to his cause had witnessed the crossing of
the giant.</p>

<p>Mason from his position saw this form rise up,
and he realized the danger of the late oarsman,
but not by word or deed did he attempt to warn
the giant who was his deadly foe.</p>

<p>There was no necessity for a warning, however,
for Red Goliath saw the uprising of the tall form
that seemed almost to rival his own.</p>

<p>This modern giant and Hercules possessed a
fierce nature, similar to that of a wild beast, and
on stated occasions his thirst for blood became
almost a mania, that could only be quenched in
the life fluid of some one.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of these moods was coming upon
him even then.</p>

<p>A looker-on would have been inclined to think
so upon hearing the growl of satisfaction he gave
utterance to.</p>

<p>When foemen worthy of each other's steel come
in contact, there is seldom much time lost in
skirmishing.</p>

<p>The Red Goliath threw himself upon his Indian
foe with an agility one would hardly expect him
to possess.</p>

<p>His assault, overpowering as it seemed, was
right valiantly met by his sturdy opponent, and
as the two closed, Mason could no longer see the
particulars of the combat.</p>

<p>There was a threshing of arms for half a moment,
then came the dull, sodden sound of blows
delivered with telling force, and which must proceed
from the white man.</p>

<p>The crushing nature of these was soon made
clear.</p>

<p>One of the gigantic forms raised the other high
in the air with but feeble resistance, and dashed
him upon the ground with tremendous power.</p>

<p>As if intent on making sure of his work, the
Red Goliath stooped over his fallen foe.</p>

<p>Something gleamed in the faint light; the sound
of a blow reached Mason's ears, and the blade
did not shine when it was again raised.</p>

<p>A hoarse chuckle that would have curdled the
blood in the veins of a sensitive person proceeded
from the human vampire as he arose to his
feet, and after giving the corpse a kick with his
heavily booted foot, replaced his knife.</p>

<p>It was certainly a fair fight, and the giant had
the same privilege of slaying his fallen enemy
that was granted in the arena at the hippodrome
of Rome during ancient times; but civilization
has brought with it the noble act of forgiving
foes, which, however, such men as this seldom
practice.</p>

<p>After that half laugh of triumph, Red Goliath
stalked noiselessly away, and the boy was left
alone with his meditations and half-shaped
plans.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ADELE.</p>


<p>Only for a few moments did young Mason remain
in this state. Then his active brain
aroused him to the necessity of making each second
count.</p>

<p>His plans were only partially matured; but it
would not prove hard to fully arrange them as
time wore on, and his first move was really characteristic
of the boy.</p>

<p>Pulling out a piece of water-proof cloth, he
quickly wrapped it around his revolver, and then
stepped boldly down into the river.</p>

<p>A few seconds later he was swimming silently
for the other shore, holding the revolver out of
the water as much as possible by means of his
teeth, in which it was clasped.</p>

<p>The current carried him a little distance down
the stream, and he landed some ten or twelve
yards below the spot where Red Goliath had left
his boat.</p>

<p>Thanks to his buckskin garments, the water did
not soak through, and after emerging from the
river Mason found himself little the worse for his
swim.</p>

<p>What to do now might have puzzled some old
stagers; but the boy's action was prompt and to
the point.</p>

<p>Stepping up to the boat, he felt along the side
until his hand came in contact with a ring, and
when this was found he gave an exclamation of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Leaving the water he struck off in the same direction
the giant had taken but a few moments
before, passing by the dead Indian without even
halting to examine the body.</p>

<p>Red Goliath must have been moving very
slowly and cautiously after his fight, for Mason,
who had, either through good luck or excellent
management, hit upon the exact line of travel pursued
by the giant, caught up with him before the
outskirts of the village were gained. A moving
form, crouching low, and yet showing the immense
bulk in spite of this proceeding, was seen
not ten yards ahead of him.</p>

<p>This was what attracted Mason's eye and kept
him on the watch.</p>

<p>When the first lodges were passed, the danger
thickened around our boy friend.</p>

<p>He had two sources to guard against, the giant
on the one hand and the inhabitants of the village
he was in the midst of on the other.</p>

<p>It may be surmised from this that Mason was
very careful of his movements.</p>

<p>In spite of his size, which one would naturally
suppose conducive to clumsiness, Red Goliath
managed to get over ground with almost the
noiseless powers of a serpent.</p>

<p>He seemed to be somewhat acquainted with the
arrangement of the village, for he passed by
dozens of lodges without giving them the least
attention, his aim being to all appearances a certain
spot not far from the center of the encampment,
which was of so great a length.</p>

<p>There were several things in favor of this spying
expedition which counted in the favor of the
giant, and also his unseen follower.</p>

<p>In the first place, the night might be called
dark, for the crescent moon was at the horizon,
and although one might distinguish a form at ten
yards distance, it would be next to impossible to
declare whether the man was white or red.</p>

<p>Then again there were but a few hundred
braves in the village, and these scattered along
its entire length did not serve to even partially
fill the lodges.</p>

<p>Where some of the late inmates were the reader
knows, for brave Custer and his men fought hard,
and each dragoon slew at least one Indian before
going under.</p>

<p>What the main portion of the Sioux were about
at this time will soon be made manifest, but a
suspicion of the truth might be gleaned from the
occasional shots that were borne by the wind
from the north, where Reno had entrenched himself
on one of the bluffs overlooking the river.</p>

<p>Red Goliath kept on his way as if he had been
among the lodges before, and, to tell the truth,
this was not his first visit to the village. Several
nights before he had made one with the same
purpose that he now had in view; but an unlucky
tumble over a drunken brave had brought the
Indians swarming around him like so many bees,
and it took all the power the giant possessed to
escape. He managed to do it, however, and by
means of the canoe which we have seen him use,
in coming to the point once more.</p>

<p>After moving forward some ten minutes, even
Mason, some distance in his rear, could hear the
boisterous sound of laughter and loud talking.</p>

<p>Where it came from would not prove hard to
say, for a brilliant light, within a dwelling that
seemed to be half cabin and half lodge, proclaimed
its whereabouts.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt but what it came from
white men, or at least men who were pale faces
in looks but red devils by nature.</p>

<p>Goliath crept towards this lodge, and in another
moment was beside it.</p>

<p>The boy moved around on the other side, and
by dint of using the caution that seemed to be a
part of his nature, managed to gain the dense
shadow of the northern side without making an
iota of noise.</p>

<p>Then the thought intruded itself, what if the
giant should take a notion to make a circuit of the
lodge?</p>

<p>He would certainly be found out, and Mason
knew that discovery by this man meant death.</p>

<p>This action was promptly executed. The skins
composing the lodge were loose at the bottom,
and a pile of furs lay just within.</p>

<p>A glance at the two inmates showed that they
were interested in the contents of a suspicious-looking
keg, and paid no attention to anything
else.</p>

<p>It took the boy but a moment to glide like an
eel under the skin of the lodge, and hide among
the furs.</p>

<p>From here he could watch the two men and
hear all that was said without being in danger of
discovery.</p>

<p>They were not a very nice-looking couple to
gaze upon, not being overly well burdened with
good looks, but the boy had seen one of them before,
and it would be hard work to find any uglier
man than Pedro Sanchez in this sphere of ours;
so his companion might be said to possess some
claims of beauty when compared with the noseless,
one-eyed French creole, whose face bore the
scars of some fearful combat.</p>

<p>Pedro was tall and slim, with the agility of a
tiger combined with the ferocity of a grizzly bear.</p>

<p>He addressed his companion as Hoskins, and
between the two they seemed to be effecting a
compromise in regard to some bargain of which
the nature was soon made manifest.</p>

<p>A faint long-drawn sigh, that told of unspoken
misery close beside him, made the boy give a
start, and it was with the utmost difficulty that
he repressed the exclamation that arose to his
lips when his eyes were turned in that direction.</p>

<p>From the pole of the lodge a long torch was
stuck out, and the light of this served to illuminate
the half where the men sat, but the cabin
part was rather dim.</p>

<p>Guided by that sigh, however, the boy had little
trouble in making out a small girlish form that
crouched rather than sat upon a pile of furs, and
seemed to be intently regarding the two men who
laughed and grew merry over the whisky keg.</p>

<p>"Adele!" was the cry that arose to that brother's
lips, but he bravely repressed it, and also the
longing that had seized upon him to clasp that
dear form to his breast and defy all enemies.</p>

<p>Although his ears were drinking in all that the
two men said, yet his eyes were steadily glued
upon the light form.</p>

<p>Hark! the Creole was speaking while he held up
a tin cup that had lately belonged to one of Custer's
men, and squinted with his one eye at its
contents.</p>

<p>"<i>Carramba!</i> Hoskins, my price I think exceedingly
reasonable. If you only knew the time and
money I've spent in this matter, and what deadly
enemies I've made by my exploit, you wouldn't
begrudge me a picayune. <i>Begar!</i> I sent one of
them to his long home in the fight to-day," and
Pedro gave a hoarse laugh that grated on the
nerves like a file, and would have set a sensitive
person crazy.</p>

<p>The boy started, and unconsciously his hand
sought his head where the bullet had glanced
from it.</p>

<p>He knew now to whom he owed that debt, and
gritted his teeth as he inwardly resolved to pay
the amount with interest when the proper occasion
presented itself.</p>

<p>Hoskins did not share in his companion's mirth,
but appeared to be reflecting.</p>

<p>He soon looked up and took a sip at the liquor.</p>

<p>"Wal, mebbe the gal's worth it, squire. I've
taken a mighty shine to her purty face, and, being
in want of a wife, I guess we kin come to a
bargain. Two hundred shiners, you said, and the
hoss I own. We'll consider the question settled
then. Now let's take a look at my property."</p>

<p>Pedro jumped to his feet with alacrity, and led
the girl forward, much against her will.</p>

<p>As the torchlight fell on that sunny head, with
its masses of golden hair and tear-bedimmed face,
Mason ground his teeth in mingled rage and pity,
and at the same time drew out his revolver. It
was fated differently, however.</p>

<p>Hoskins feasted his eyes upon Adele's delicate
beauty, and the grin that came upon his face told
Pedro that he was satisfied with the bargain.</p>

<p>"Old hoss, we're squar on that. Gal, look up.
Ye're mine now, body and soul. D'ye hear me?
I've bought ye with a price, and I'd jest like fur
the man to show himself what's goin' to take ye
from me," said Hoskins.</p>

<p>There was a queer ripping sound. Mason saw
a shining blade cut the skins of the lodge as if
they were paper, and through this opening leaped
Red Goliath, with a revolver in one hand and
a knife in the other, and the brief exclamation of
"I'm the identical chap."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOSKINS PAYS NATURE'S DEBT&mdash;ABOUT THE FIRST
HE EVER DID.</p>


<p>Hoskins may have been astonished at this sudden
intrusion and answer to the vain question he
asked. I have no doubt but what he was, more
especially when his eyes took in the huge form of
the giant, but his surprise was as nothing when
compared to the consternation exhibited by the
creole.</p>

<p>Pedro Sanchez had appeared in the jolliest possible
humor a few moments before; now, the
smile that had illuminated his face at the time of
the giant's entrance seemed frozen there.</p>

<p>Pedro Sanchez had good cause to remember
Red Goliath.</p>

<p>The two had been comrades in crime, and together
they had committed many of the deeds
that made the city of New Orleans tremble to its
center.</p>

<p>Between them they had carried off Adele, hoping
to secure a heavy ransom from her mother.</p>

<p>At this time the treachery so natural to Sanchez
exhibited itself.</p>

<p>A desire to obtain the whole reward, on which
he could retire from business, possessed him, and
he attempted to get rid of his comrade by pushing
the giant over the edge of an abyss on the southern
plains.</p>

<p>The creole really thought the other dead, but
in some way Red Goliath escaped with severe injuries,
that laid him up for months at a cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>There he became acquainted with a gentleman
who had recently left New Orleans for his health,
having slain his distinguished foeman in a duel,
and who intended staying away until the affair
blew over.</p>

<p>In a conversation with this man, the giant became
acquainted with several things that entirely
changed the tenor of his ideas, and an understanding
followed between them.</p>

<p>When Red Goliath started on the trail of vengeance,
he had no intention of restoring Adele to
her mother for a ransom, as a much larger sum
had been offered him than he could ever expect
from the lady, to carry her away to a point from
whence she should never return, and the duelist
had even hinted that he should not weep very
much should news of her death reach him.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that Adele Pierrepont
and her brother, Mason, stood between Luke
Camden, the duelist and an immense fortune,
and the idea of getting rid of the two had only
entered his head when he heard through the giant
that the girl had already been carried away.</p>

<p>Red Goliath proved a true traitor.</p>

<p>He had tracked his treacherous companion all
the way from the plains of Texas to the pastures
in the north, where the white man joined teams
with Sitting Bull's gang of plunderers and thieves,
where his merits in the peculiar line of business
he dealt in were duly appreciated.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the creole shivered in
dread when he saw the man whom he had attempted
to murder standing before him with a
deadly revolver in his hand, and cruel vengeance
flashing from his eyes.</p>

<p>At first Pedro's hands failed to do their duty,
and hung limp by his sides.</p>

<p>"Aha! it is thus we meet, my fine chicken,"
said the giant, who evidently had a tinge of the
dramatic in his nature.</p>

<p>By the light of the torch it could now be seen
that his hair and beard gave rise to the first half
of his name, being of a fiery hue.</p>

<p>His eyes were small and deep-set, glittering
like a snake's.</p>

<p>Pedro Sanchez was actually too frightened to
say a word in answer to this implied question.</p>

<p>He could only stand and glare like a wild beast
at bay and powerless to help itself.</p>

<p>The giant seemed rather talkative in his triumph.</p>

<p>"Pushed Red Goliath down a gulch, half a
mile deep. Thought he'd die like a rat in its
hole. Aha! my fine fellow, bushes are great inventions;
thanks to them I am here now&mdash;here
to claim my vengeance. Five thousand dollars
tempted you, did it? Well, I want to tell you I'm
offered double as much to keep the gal away forever:
kill her if I like. Now, Brutus, your time
has about come. Are you ready to meet your
just doom?"</p>

<p>Pedro was shivering as only a man can who
sees instant death before him, and his chattering
teeth precluded the possibility of a reply.</p>

<p>The giant smiled derisively, and turned his
eyes on Hoskins.</p>

<p>At this critical period the individual proved
himself the possessor of more courage than the
boasting creole.</p>

<p>Perhaps this arose from his ignorance of the
giant's power, which Pedro was well acquainted
with.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce are you that comes breaking
into a man's house, and talking about doom and
all that sort of thing? By George! I've a notion
to&mdash;&mdash;" began Hoskins in a blustering tone, but
he came to an abrupt pause, for the giant seeing
where it was most needed had swung the revolver
around until it covered his form.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken. You haven't any notion at
all, and it'll be better for your health if you don't
have any. Asked me what I came here for; you
invited me; declared you would like to see the
man that was going to take the gal from you, so
I showed myself. Now, my rooster, what's what
with you?"</p>

<p>Hoskins seemed to have some spirit in him at
any rate.</p>

<p>"Fool," said he, "one shot from your pistol
would put you in a hornet's nest. If I choose
to shout, a hundred braves will surround the
lodge."</p>

<p>"As to the alarm, I care nothing for that; knew
I couldn't do any work without raising it; but I
swear you shan't shout again in this world,
though you may in the one below us. Die, you
dog."</p>

<p>The sudden startling crack of a revolver rang
out.</p>

<p>Red Goliath had fired. There was an awful
shudder on the part of Hoskins; a gurgling
sound as if he was trying to curse his slayer, and
then the stricken man fell to the ground shot
through the heart. Turning on the creole, Red
Goliath again raised his death-dealing revolver.</p>

<p>Pedro had slunk away and was crouching on
the ground.</p>

<p>At this contemptible display of cowardice, the
giant gave him a hearty kick of derision, in order
to induce him to stand erect; but it only had the
effect of flattening the miscreant out still more.</p>

<p>There was no time to waste, as the Indians
must already be alarmed.</p>

<p>Firing two shots into the dark corner where
Pedro had crouched, the giant hurriedly replaced
his weapons.</p>

<p>Then like a flash he seized upon Adele, lifted
her light form as easily as if she had been a
feather, and dashed out.</p>

<p>An Indian met him just beyond the lodge.</p>

<p>One sweep of the giant's disengaged arm sent
him to the ground like a ten-pin overwhelmed by
a ball.</p>

<p>Although braves were appearing in every direction,
Red Goliath sped onward like an antelope,
the burden he carried appeared as nothing.</p>

<p>The village was soon left behind, and when the
open ground was at length gained, two shadowy
figures flitting close behind him proclaimed the
fact that these were his only pursuers.</p>

<p>To get rid of them was an easy task to a man
like the Hercules, who was well versed in every
detail of fight and strategy, and armed into the
bargain.</p>

<p>Again the revolver came into play.</p>

<p>Suddenly halting, and wheeling in his tracks,
he presented the weapon.</p>

<p>With its first crack one of the pursuers described
a parabola in the air, as if he had leaped
from a spring-board, and upon touching the
ground lay very, very quiet.</p>

<p>The second attempted to dodge, but soon found
out that lead can travel mortally fast when driven
by powder.</p>

<p>He made his way into camp half an hour later
with a broken arm, and the bullet lodged in his
side.</p>

<p>Having thus rid himself of both pursuers, the
giant once more rushed along.</p>

<p>The river bank was gained, and also the
canoe.</p>

<p>"Whoop! hurrah! won it, by George! run the
gauntlet too," said the daring man to himself, as
he placed Adele, too powerless with terror to resist,
in the boat; and after pushing the craft off,
sprang in himself.</p>

<p>Young Mason had been so taken aback by the
giant's sudden shots and his rapid flight that
even had he so wished he could have done nothing
to prevent him.</p>

<p>Before he actually realized what had occurred,
Red Goliath had vanished from the lodge, carrying
the boy's darling sister with him.</p>

<p>It seemed but half a minute had passed, and
Mason was about to rise up from his place of
concealment and follow on the giant's trail, when
half a dozen Indians burst into the lodge to see
what damage had been done here.</p>

<p>Hoskins would never steal another horse, he
had gone to that bourne from whence no traveler
e'er returns; in a word he was dead.</p>

<p>Pedro came crawling out of the dark corner
with a hole in him large enough to let the life out
of any common man, but which did not appear
to inconvenience him at all.</p>

<p>For several moments they jabbered away in a
tongue unknown to our hero, much to his disgust,
for he was impatient.</p>

<p>When they at length left the lodge, Pedro securing
the gold his late companion possessed
before doing so, Mason gave a sigh of relief, and
made haste to throw off the warm furs in which
he had been wrapped.</p>

<p>Then he boldly stalked from the lodge, walking
as if he had a perfect right in the village.
Several times he came across braves, and on such
occasions grasped hold of a revolver, ready for
service, but his bearing must have deceived the
red-skins, for he was not molested.</p>

<p>After gaining the outskirts of the village, Mason
struck at once for the river.</p>

<p>He knew that it was too late to reach the place
where the canoe had been left before the giant,
and had resolved to wait for it at a point below.</p>

<p>The wisdom of his course was soon made apparent,
for his sharp eyes caught sight of a dark
object moving slowly down the river near the
other bank.</p>

<p>It was Red Goliath's canoe.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHITE THUNDER ON THE RAMPAGE.</p>


<p>When Bolly Wherrit left the great Indian camp
behind him, and headed for the distant hills, he
had no intention of leaving the vicinity.</p>

<p>An object had attracted him hither, which,
though backed by a golden reward, had something
else behind it as an invigorator that proved
far more potent with the old ranger than the
money involved.</p>

<p>His own words had proclaimed that the cause
of his hastening north, leaving his chum Pandy
Ellis in the thick of some business that concerned
them both, was a beautiful woman's tears.</p>

<p>Bolly always was weak as regarded the other
sex, and knowing this reverence of his, which
can hardly be called a failing, it has been a continual
wonder to me why the ranger never married,
especially as he must have been a fine-looking
fellow in his younger days, judging from
the grand old face he possesses at the present
writing.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect, however, that in his youth
Bolly had loved and been deceived, and although
he never ceased caring for the ladies, he regarded
them with suspicion when he came to the point.</p>

<p>As he rode along Bolly was engaged in various
conjectures, the main subject of which was the
rescue of Adele, for the reader must know by this
time that this was the object that had sent Bolly
from New Orleans to this northern province in
such haste.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking down in the western sky,
and the shadows were growing very long, when
Bolly reached the hills.</p>

<p>A stream of water, so cold that one could
almost believe it an ice spring, murmured among
the stone, and pursued its tortuous way through
the neighboring ravine, heading for the Little
Horn, where its waters were quickly engulfed by
the larger stream.</p>

<p>At this Bolly came to a halt, and allowed Black
Bess to drink all that she wished, dismounting
first to quench his own thirst.</p>

<p>The ranger did not attempt to climb the hills,
as it would have proven a difficult task, and one
which there was no necessity for, as he intended
doing some work before morning came on.</p>

<p>Longer grew the shadows, and more gloomy
the ravines between the elevations, as the prairie
ranger galloped slowly along the foot of the
range.</p>

<p>Night at length closed around him; the peaks
were dimly outlined against the sky in which the
stars began to appear.</p>

<p>In the west the infant moon looked like a silver
bond of promise to the good welfare of man, and
smiled upon the earth as if in pity at its forlorn
and unlighted condition.</p>

<p>All of these things Bolly noticed with the air of
a man whose mind is preoccupied, and whose
thoughts have no range beyond a certain point.</p>

<p>Now that quite a distance separated him from
the huge Sioux village, the usual sounds that accompany
a night upon the plains came to his
ears, and it really seemed as though the wolves
howled and the coyotes barked louder than ever
on this particular occasion.</p>

<p>Perhaps with their more than human instinct,
these beasts of carrion knew of the feast for their
hungry maws, that the setting sun had shone
upon, and which was not yet ready for them because
of the many moving figures in that terrible
ravine of death.</p>

<p>A whippoorwill sending forth his plaintive cry
near by, and the shrill scream of a night hawk
from a neighboring tree, aroused Bolly from the
stupor as it might almost be called, into which he
had unconsciously fallen.</p>

<p>For the first time he noticed that Black Bess
had carried him into the midst of a forest that lay
at the foot of the hills.</p>

<p>As he made this discovery, the distant murmur
of running water came to his ears, which could
not be made by a creek.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the river that he was nearing,
and as this was just what he desired, Bolly let
his sable steed continue her own course.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he brought the animal to a
halt.</p>

<p>Before him rolled the Little Horn with its shady
banks, the starlight glinting from the tiny waves
that the adverse wind gave rise to.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly Bolly looked at the water.</p>

<p>He had built his schemes upon the river, and
being in a contemplative mood, he was wondering
whether the morning would see him successful or
the reverse.</p>

<p>From this serious state he was abruptly aroused
by a sound that to ears of experience like his bespoke
danger.</p>

<p>Only a twig snapped by some incautious foot,
but it had a world of meaning to the ranger.</p>

<p>As if it affected him like electricity, Bolly slid
from the back of Black Bess, and crouched on
that side of the horse nearest to the seat of
danger.</p>

<p>The rifle he held was laid gently upon the
ground, and in its stead he quickly laid hold of
the formidable knife taken from the Indian who
had been placed over his prison as a guard.</p>

<p>Although these movements were accomplished
with all the noiseless powers of a tiger, Bolly was
not unobserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Two pair of gleaming eyes had noted his descent
from the horse, and hardly had the ranger
laid hold of his knife than he was called upon to
use it.</p>

<p>A form arose lightly in the air, and passing over
the bushes like a bird, landed close beside him.</p>

<p>Following this came a second, and as this man
landed he gave a fierce shout, the pent-up air of
his jump forcing itself through his teeth with the
shrill force of a steam-whistle.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as taking Bolly Wherrit
unawares. A man who had earned the name
of White Thunder and Never Sleep among the
northern tribes might be surprised, as he was not
possessed of a second sight to divine ambuscades,
but his enemies always found him ready.</p>

<p>The first man who leaped went to immediate
death, for, as he braced himself to recover from
the force of his jump, the ranger gave one spring
and plunged his knife forward. It entered the
broad red chest with a sickening thud, and when
Bolly pulled it out again, a perfect deluge of blood
followed.</p>

<p>Sickening as was the sight of this tottering man,
actually turning pale from loss of blood, we soldiers
have to witness far more terrible things, such
as would make a civilian faint with horror.</p>

<p>The old ranger had seen worse in his day, when
dear comrades were roasted before his eyes at
the stake, and besides he had no time to waste in
heroics.</p>

<p>His second foeman aimed a vicious blow at his
head with a tomahawk that glittered like steel or
silver as it flew by.</p>

<p>This intended death-blow Bolly avoided by a
dip of the head, and in another instant the two
were locked in a close embrace.</p>

<p>The Indian had managed to lay hold of his
knife, so that the combatants were equally well
armed.</p>

<p>Before a dozen seconds had passed Bolly discovered
that he had no puny antagonist with
whom to combat, for the fellow seemed to possess
muscles of iron, and even by exerting all his
strength, the ranger failed to raise him from the
ground to dash him down, as he had done many
a man before.</p>

<p>They were in such a situation that if either attempted
to use his knife, the other would have
the advantage for an instant, and even this short
time might prove disastrous to all cherished hopes
of victory.</p>

<p>An idea came into Bolly's head which told him
that the advantage really lay in his favor, for
while fully the Indian's equal in strength, he also
possessed some knowledge of scientific wrestling,
against which the brave could oppose nothing in
the same line.</p>

<p>The chance soon presented itself, and was
promptly seized upon.</p>

<p>By an adroit fling of his foot, and a corresponding
whirl with his arms, the ranger completely
demolished his sturdy but ignorant foeman.</p>

<p>Falling underneath, the Indian knew that his
chances of escape were slight, indeed, unless he
managed to hold the ranger down, and dropping
his knife, he attempted to accomplish this by
clasping Bolly around the chest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, for him, his hands
failed to meet, and he could not put forth his full
amount of strength.</p>

<p>Our old friend broke loose from the death clasp.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm burst from the doomed man's
lips when he saw the red blade uplifted, but the
outstretched arms were dashed aside, and the
knife descended.</p>

<p>"That fur Tom Garny, blast yer hide," he muttered,
and his foe was dead.</p>

<p>As the ranger was shaking himself to see that
no material damage had befallen him through his
recent struggle, the reports of several guns, followed
by savage shouts, came from the bluffs
across the river and further up. It proceeded
from besieged Reno and his foes, but Bolly did
not know this.</p>

<p>"Ah! sum o' ye over yonder I reckon. Wonder
what became o' Custer, for it must hev been him,
az no wun else'd rush inter danger like that.
Sounds mighty bad; they hain't kerried the
town, an' I'm afraid the yaller-haired chief hez
either gone under or else had ter retreat, a thing I
never knew him ter do, long az I've been acquainted&mdash;ha!
what in blazes! Bolly Wherrit,
down ye imp. Bess, silence now, old girl. Byes,
do yer juty now, fur thar's sumpin' a comin' this
way that needs lookin' arter."</p>

<p>The ranger sank out of sight as if he had been
shot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">RENO'S RIFLE-PITS ON THE RIVER BLUFFS.</p>


<p>The human mind differs so greatly with various
individuals that what might be said of one
person, proves exactly the opposite in another.</p>

<p>It has truly been remarked that one man's food
is poison to another, and the same may be said of
the capacity of their intellect.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis, the veteran ranger of the wild
West, whose days had been passed among scenes
of danger from boyhood up to old age, was the
possessor of an iron will and a stout heart.</p>

<p>He had witnessed, almost with composure, it
might be said, scenes that would have made many
a brave man turn pale and tremble; had passed
through others, not unscratched either, when
dear friends fell to rise no more, and yet had not
been shocked.</p>

<p>The utter annihilation of Custer's devoted command
had actually appalled him, and put him in
the gloomiest state possible.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the fearful fact that not one in
that gallant band came out to tell the tale, that
worked so on his feelings.</p>

<p>Had some escaped, the affair would have lost
some of that horrible fascination that proceeded
from the fact that every one, officers and men
alike, had been swept into eternity, just as surely
as if an earthquake had swallowed them.</p>

<p>Eagle Eye, the Crow chief, had promised to
send some of his men with the news to Terry; at
least his silence had been the same as an acquiescence,
and this finished his obligations toward
the ill-fated Colonel Yates.</p>

<p>The sound of firing in the advance told Pandy
that Major Reno was actively engaged on the
bluffs, and aroused by the thought that there was
hot work yet before him, he urged Nancy forward.
As night closed about him, it could not
but be conducive of gloomy thoughts, for the
darkness appeared to communicate itself to the
mind in some way or other, keeping brighter
ideas at bay.</p>

<p>As he advanced, carefully now, as the way was
rough and unfamiliar, the sounds in front grew
clearer until the old ranger knew that he was
drawing near the scene of action.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to join Reno on horseback,
if the position of the troops was as bad as
he suspected, and the next thing for him to do,
would be to hide Nancy in some place where <i>he</i>
could find her again, but no one else.</p>

<p>Such a spot he was not long in ferreting out,
and after securing the horse by means of his
lariat, Pandy moved forward once more.</p>

<p>Louder came the detonation from guns and
shouts from dusky throats, threatening everything
that was terrible to the remnant of the gallant
Seventh; and yet their answering yells and
shots proved the young fellows to be undaunted
by the fate that seemed staring them in the face.</p>

<p>Pandy stood and listened, on the brow of an
eminence, striving to pierce the gloom ahead with
those eagle-like eyes.</p>

<p>Something like a cheer arose to his mouth at
the unflinching bravery exhibited by these blue-coated
heroes, as they gave back shout for shout.</p>

<p>Although the light at a distance was deceptive
and uncertain, he could make out that Reno had
planted his command on the top of the bluffs, to
stand what might be called a siege.</p>

<p>In the haste of the movement, and worried by
the Indians, the courageous major had, unfortunately
for those under his command, selected a
spot that was controlled by higher points on either
side.</p>

<p>From one of these latter it would not have been
a very difficult task to keep the enemy at bay,
but now he had a double danger to contend
against, as the Indians occupied the heights
around him, and also attempted to storm his
position.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the handful of the gallant
Seventh who lived through this night and
the succeeding day, will ever forget how the minutes
dragged on, and yet I have no doubt but
what in these dangerous hours some of them
joked and laughed with that terrible <i>sang froid</i>
men often assume when all hope is gone.</p>

<p>From his position the old prairie ranger could
see that some kind of earthwork or rifle-pits had
been constructed, and behind these rough shelters
the tigers fought their fiendish foemen.</p>

<p>As yet Major Reno's men had had no suspicion
of the awful calamity that had overtaken Custer
and his three hundred men. So confident of success
had the general been, that he divided what
troops he had, so as to inclose the Indian village.</p>

<p>When they galloped away, it was the last that
had been seen of them. True, some firing had
been heard several miles away, long continued, as
though an obstinate battle was in progress; but
this had died away by evening.</p>

<p>Opinions differed, as they always will among
many men. Some felt sure that Custer had defeated
the Indians, marched on the village, and
that any moment they might expect to see a huge
bonfire in progress.</p>

<p>Others of a more reflective nature looked at the
matter in a more serious light, thinking it not improbable
that dashing Custer himself had been
the sufferer, and that he would find it difficult to
join them; but none ever suspected the horrible
truth even for a moment.</p>

<p>That five companies of the bravest men in the
old Seventh should have been completely swept
out of existence was something almost preposterous.</p>

<p>When Pandy found himself gazing upon this
scene, he began pinching himself, uncertain
whether to believe his eyes or not.</p>

<p>"Lord help us, what's ther world comin' to, I'd
like ter know? Wen these hyar reds gobble up ther
bravest gineral az ever drew breath wid all his
men, and then squat down round ther rest as if
ther meal warn't complete, it's time ole Uncle
Samuel war wakin' up. Blast my hide, ole Sitting
Bull must be extarminated for this. I shall
never hev any peace in life till it's done. But
looky hyar now, ole man, bizness must be 'tended
to. Ye'd like ter be wid Reno an' his men yonder,
so az ter share in ther fun. Don't see any
other way o' gittin' round it. Needs must wen
ther devil drives, az ther feller sez. Now, jest
show us wat ye kin do at this advanced period o'
life in this line."</p>

<p>Communing with himself in his way the ranger
began descending the elevation from which he had
seen at the same time as much and as little. The
valley below looked forbidding, but to a man of
Pandy's nature, and who had so recently passed
through such a horrible affair, a thing like this
did not serve to daunt in the least. Soon he
found himself gulfed in the darkness; the shots
came from above him, and ten minutes after
quitting his post of observation, an eagle's eyrie
as it seemed, the trapper was cautiously making
his way upward again.</p>

<p>There were manifold sources of danger on all
sides against which he was compelled to guard
himself. In every red warrior (and the hill actually
swarmed with them) he had a deadly foe as
a white man, and an inveterate one as the only
Pandy Ellis. Besides there was a chance that
the gallant boys above, deeming every moving
object an enemy, would either fire upon him, or
use their sabers as he attempted to mount the
breastworks. It was a risky business, but one
in which Pandy delighted.</p>

<p>Making use of each bush and rock, he slowly
ascended the steep inclined plane. At times he
was so close to some of the Indians, that he
might have touched them with his arm had he
so desired; but the reader may rest assured,
Pandy did not take the trouble to test this. He
was fated, however, to meet with one scrape
before gaining his destination, and which came
very near being fatal to him.</p>

<p>It was among a cluster of rocks, and the ranger
had mounted a sort of cliff to expedite matters.
Accidents are not confined alone to the careless,
although they meet with more than the prudent,
no doubt. Pandy's foot slipped and over he went.</p>

<p>It was certainly mortifying that after taking
five minutes to get up this nice little cliff, he
should descend it in a few seconds; it would
have been even more so had he landed on the
hard rocks below, for the fall was no petty one.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, however, an Indian
brave happened to be below, and on this poor
devil came the brunt of the tumble.</p>

<p>This being in the shape of a hundred and sixty
pounds avoirdupois, proved to be too much for
the equanimity of his mind and the balance of
his body, as the poor fellow immediately collapsed.</p>

<p>He was only a little confused, however, and
had sense enough to lay hold of the object that
struck him, so that Pandy sought the ground
almost as soon as did the other.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Indian had a vague notion that it
was a comrade who had fallen upon him. If so,
then he had no time to frame this idea into a
thought, for the hill-top fell over upon him, at
least the warrior thought so when he opened his
eyes hours later in this world of pain.</p>

<p>Pandy had only given him a sound argument
in the shape of a blow between the eyes.</p>

<p>Again the ranger pursued his upward way.</p>

<p>The small cliff was successfully scaled, and
beyond this traveling seemed much easier so far
as lifeless obstructions were concerned.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to follow Pandy's movements
after this; they were inimical with those
of a snake, crawling hither and thither, passing
under the noses of red watchers, and close beside
the fighting braves.</p>

<p>How he did it the trapper chief could not tell
himself. With a thousand chances against him,
he successfully gave the savage Sioux the slip,
and, all unknown to them, passed from their
outer line, and scaling the rudely thrown up
earth-works, found himself among the rifle pits
of the soldiers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BOY TRAILER AT WORK.</p>


<p>It needed no second look to convince Mason
that it was the giant's canoe his eyes beheld, nor
did he stop to examine the moving object more
closely.</p>

<p>Having arranged his course of action long before,
he now stepped quietly into the water, and
when it reached as high as his neck, began swimming
out.</p>

<p>So dexterous were the movements of the boy
trailer, whose cause Custer had taken up so
readily, and might have carried out but for his
untimely death, that no sound resulted from his
locomotion through the water, beyond that which
even the most suspicious of mortals would take
to be the swishing of the wind-driven wavelets.</p>

<p>When the canoe came even with the spot on
which he had stood before entering the water,
Mason was directly in front of it.</p>

<p>As only his head remained above the water and
the giant's direction was directed further on, it
was not strange that Red Goliath failed to discover
anything suspicious just at the prow of his
canoe.</p>

<p>The boat glided past, and Mason's hand sought
the ring he had hunted up previously.</p>

<p>Luckily he found it, and in this way managed
to keep alongside of the boat, just behind the
giant.</p>

<p>Red Goliath stood up like a statue, and for
such he might indeed have been taken but for the
regular pendulum motion of his arms, as the
paddle was shifted from side to side, in order
that the momentum caused by the current might
be materially aided by long silent sweeps.</p>

<p>Adele sat in the bow, motionless.</p>

<p>Young Mason's heart gave a great throb of
sympathy when he heard what sounded suspiciously
like a sob from the girl.</p>

<p>His sister had been stolen from her home in
New Orleans by Hoskins and this giant, and like
a sleuth-hound this boy had followed on the trail,
tracking the fugitives from one border town to
another on their northward course, and yet always
coming too late.</p>

<p>He had met Custer years before, and had been
a friend of the yellow-haired cavalry leader, so
when he found the general in these regions, the
latter at once took up his cause, and sent out
scouts to discover where Hoskins and his fair girl
captive were.</p>

<p>These men, experienced as they were, failed to
accomplish their end.</p>

<p>It was Mason himself, by his indefatigable efforts,
who first discovered Sitting Bull's village,
and reported the fact to the general, who was already
heading in that direction, aiming for the
Little Big Horn.</p>

<p>The boy also declared that Hoskins was with
the Indians, which fact Custer was prone to believe.</p>

<p>After this Mason vanished, nor did he make his
appearance until the doomed command was riding
down the bluffs into the ambuscade.</p>

<p>How the latter proved fatal to the gallant troops
is already known.</p>

<p>The wily Sioux allowed them to come on, pretending
to give way, until the men were fairly in
the trap, when they closed about them in a solid
mass.</p>

<p>After this explanation, which I hold as due to
the reader, I will resume the thread of my narrative
where it was dropped.</p>

<p>The canoe passed down the stream for several
miles in this way.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that Red Goliath, shrewd
as he has shown himself to be, should risk so
much in passing the Indian village after arousing
the inhabitants by creating such an alarm, but
the fact was, he proved to be one of those cunning
fellows who believe that under the existing
circumstances the safest place is that nearest the
seat of action.</p>

<p>In spite of the danger that seemed to encompass
him, the giant passed by without an
alarm.</p>

<p>Soon the firing on the right shore could be
heard, and this became louder as they drew nearer,
until they were abreast of the scene of Reno's
obstinate defense.</p>

<p>Passing by, the giant continued on its way
down the river, until Mason began to wonder
whether it would ever stop, his poor arm feeling
the effects of the long pull.</p>

<p>Red Goliath had another object in view while
taking this route, besides that already mentioned.</p>

<p>There was a cave in the hills below the village
which he intended to occupy; for, although Adele
was in his hands, only half of the mission which
he had been intrusted with by the duelist was accomplished.</p>

<p>The boy yet remained, and although the words
he had heard Hoskins boastfully utter had created
a suspicion in his mind that Mason had fallen
with Custer's command, he intended remaining
in the vicinity until this could be proven by
searching the battle-field.</p>

<p>Shortly after passing the bluffs where Reno was
battling with overwhelming numbers of crafty
foemen, the giant made a sudden sweep with the
paddle, and turned the prow toward the shore.</p>

<p>As the boat struck, he sprang out and pulled it
into a clump of bushes, which, with the reeds
growing near the bank, proved an effectual hiding-place.
Adele still sat motionless.</p>

<p>The giant addressed her, for the first time since
starting on his water voyage, and Mason could see
her tremble at the sound of his rough voice, as if
it meant something of horror.</p>

<p>"Come, gal, we leave the creek here. There's
a snug little hiding-place I intend taking you to,
where there'll be no chance of discovery. Now
that you're in my power again, I don't intend
losing sight of you. You're in somebody's way,
therefore you have to be removed. It depends
on yourself how this is to be done. Two ways
are open: one, by carrying you off to some foreign
land; t'other, leaving you to the mercy of the
forest beasts," and the unfeeling giant laughed to
himself.</p>

<p>"And they would prove more merciful than
such a monster as you," declared Adele, as she
stepped from the unsteady boat and faced Red
Goliath. How her eyes shone, as they flashed
out the scorn born of her soul!</p>

<p>"Bravo! I see the little gal hain't lost her
spirit yet. I acknowledge the corn without hesitation;
hain't got such a thing as a heart; never
had, either. Remember how I used to delight in
pinching the wings of butterflies, and running
pins through 'em when I was a little boy&mdash;which,
considering my present size, was a long time ago.
So you see, gal, I must be what they call a modern
monstrosity, a man without a heart. However,
I can say this hain't my doing. I only
wanted to get a ransom from your mother; but
this other fellow must step into the pie."</p>

<p>"Do you think I can't tell who you mean? It
is a fit idea to originate with such a man as Luke
Camden," said the girl, in scornful tones.</p>

<p>Red Goliath started, and when he spoke his
voice was as gruff as ever.</p>

<p>"Remember, I mention no names. Now, gal,
we'll be going. Give me your hand."</p>

<p>Adele drew back with a shudder of horror;
willingly she would never touch it.</p>

<p>"I will walk beside you in plain view," she
said.</p>

<p>"All right," growled the giant, who could not
but notice the shudder and knew its import, and
he looked at his hand as if half believing that he
would see the red marks that had so often dyed
it.</p>

<p>"All right, my gal; but remember no tricks, or
as sure as there is life in the air we breathe, I
shall shoot you down;" and as if to enforce this
horrible threat, he whipped out a revolver.</p>

<p>Side by side, the man and his intended victim
walked through the woods. When speaking of
his method of traveling, stalked would be a better
word, for he covered three or four feet with
every step, so that Adele was compelled to almost
run in order to keep up with him.</p>

<p>Neither of them saw the water-drenched form
that flitted from tree to tree in their rear.</p>

<p>Half a mile, perhaps, was covered.</p>

<p>Mason, on several occasions, thought he heard
a noise in his rear, as though the trailer himself
was being trailed; but his attention being
almost fully occupied in front, it soon passed from
his mind.</p>

<p>The hills were reached at length, and the ascent
commenced.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had passed Red Goliath
came to a pause.</p>

<p>Before them a black orifice yawned in the
rocks. The giant made Adele enter first, and
himself followed after, as if afraid lest she should
give him the slip after all.</p>

<p>Another moment and they stood in a cavern
some twenty feet square, the dimensions of
which could be seen by the star-light that found
ingress through the large cracks above.</p>

<p>In spite of his protestations as to not harming
her, there were dark thoughts in the mind of
the giant.</p>

<p>Bloody deeds were every-day affairs with him;
the girl stood in his way; therefore she must be
removed.</p>

<p>Why he had not done the deed before I cannot
say.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in the beginning his plan was different;
and, once in the canoe, the outcry she
would make might draw a cordon of enemies
around him.</p>

<p>Red Goliath replaced his revolver and drew his
knife, running his finger along the edge in a deliberate
way.</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed like those of a snake, and
appeared to fascinate the girl.</p>

<p>Not a word did the giant utter, but his actions
needed no explanation.</p>

<p>He took a step towards Adele.</p>

<p>She sank on her knees terribly frightened at
the savage monster's move.</p>

<p>The little hands were clasped and wrung despairingly,
but they might just as well have appealed
to a man of stone.</p>

<p>As the long blade was raised the light glittered
along the steel.</p>

<p>"Be merciful, as you expect to receive mercy,"
moaned Adele.</p>

<p>The giant did not expect any mercy; at least
his actions betokened as much, for, as if he had
not heard her at all, he continued to advance.</p>

<p>Another step and he would be upon her.</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink even closer to the rocky
floor, and seeing no hope in that ferocious countenance,
covered her eyes with her hands to shut
out the dread sight.</p>

<p>Unknown to himself, Red Goliath was sealing
his own doom.</p>

<p>As the knife quivered in the air, and was just
about to descend, Mason's voice rang out through
the cavern.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A MAN WHO NEVER BROOKED AN INSULT.</p>


<p>Once within the rifle pits, Pandy Ellis drew
his breath more easily, for the present danger
was over.</p>

<p>The first person he met was garbed as an officer,
and this man, although brave as a lion,
proved to be an arrogant fellow in this time of
danger.</p>

<p>"Whar kin I see Major Reno?" asked the
ranger, laying his hand on the arm of the officer,
a familiarity he seemed to resent, for he shook it
off as he turned haughtily toward the other.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, fellow, when all
brave men are at work?"</p>

<p>Pandy smiled a little.</p>

<p>He entertained a curious feeling toward the
army.</p>

<p>In one way he felt a contempt for them, and
then again he almost reverenced everything pertaining
to the great governmental system.</p>

<p>"Because I've jest come in; crawled among the
reds. Been wid Custer, an' by ther Lord Harry,
seen ther general an' every man wiped out," said
Pandy.</p>

<p>"Look here, fellow; what canard is this?" demanded
the officer.</p>

<p>The ranger overlooked the insulting speech;
for he knew that what he said was astounding
news.</p>

<p>His tone was dignified when he repeated it,
however.</p>

<p>"I said Custer, Cooke, Gates, Keogh and every
man of 'em had gone under."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, man alive; there is something
behind this. Look here, fellow, do you
know what we do with spies?" A vague notion
had entered the officer's head that this might be
a ruse of the enemy to force Reno to surrender.</p>

<p>Pandy's eyes flashed fire; here was something
he could not stand.</p>

<p>"Do ye know what I would do wid such cusses
as you? Wal, sir, I'd jist snap ye atween my
fingers like a pipe-stem, bust me ef I wudn't,"
said Pandy, grimly.</p>

<p>"And this to me!" exclaimed the officer, in
such a tragic voice, that had Pandy ever read
Scott's works he would have been reminded of
Marmion and the noble earl, Lord Douglas.
"Who the devil are you, sir, may I inquire?"</p>

<p>It was evident that the man in authority had
taken the ranger for one of the regular scouts
belonging to the expedition, until his thoughts
ranged on something worse.</p>

<p>"What am I? A free ranger; man who never
took an insult in his life from red or white. Who
am I? I reckon I'm a man, sir, which is more than
kin be sed o' you. My name? I never was
ashamed of it. If ye'll go an' let Major Reno
know what I told you, an' say ter him that Pandy
Ellis sent ye, thar'll be no more sed about the
matter."</p>

<p>The soldier leaned forward, and peered at the
thin face of this leathern-clad warrior. Pandy
stood like a rock, and their eyes met.</p>

<p>"It's him; curse me if I haven't put my foot
into it;" and, wheeling about, the officer strode
away, his sword jingling musically when it came
in contact with the spur that adorned his heels.
He never reported to Major Reno, as a ball laid
him low not three minutes afterward.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis was a curious fellow, taciturn, one
might call him. Although he fought through the
night side by side with the cavalrymen, he never
once mentioned a word of what he had seen, supposing
the officer had reported to Reno, and that
the major did not communicate the news to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
men for fear of disheartening them. His duty
had been done in this respect, and he was satisfied,
although, of course, the ranger could not
help wondering why he was not called upon to
give a full report of the awful battle.</p>

<p>The night passed in those rifle pits, with death
hovering close by, and seizing upon a comrade
every little while, will never be forgotten by those
who have survived the dread ordeal.</p>

<p>Again and again did the Indians attempt to
force their position, only to fall back in confusion
from the defense offered by those valorous sons
of the republic who fought on with the black
shadow hovering above them and the bullets,
commanding their position, rattling about their
ears.</p>

<p>It was a moment to be remembered until time
shall be no more.</p>

<p>Morning broke at last, but did not materially
change their prospects; for what was a benefit to
them proved the same to their foes; each side
could now make their bullets tell.</p>

<p>Brave men fell during the day&mdash;men whose records
in the memory of their fellow-soldiers will
doubtless be their only monuments.</p>

<p>Pandy fought through it all like a hero.</p>

<p>It was familiar business to the veteran ranger;
and it might be noticed that every time he fired
(which was frequently) he cut a fresh little notch
on the handle of his tomahawk.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis was the first man to avenge the
death of Custer and his men.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, even the most cheerful began
to grow discouraged.</p>

<p>Surrounded by tireless enemies thirsting for
their blood; without water to quench the fierce
longing that commenced to prey upon them; and
no signs of aid from either Custer or Terry, their
case was indeed becoming desperate.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the 26th of June,
that keen-eyed Pandy Ellis discovered that the
Indians' village had vanished, so far as lodges
and people were concerned.</p>

<p>This gave him grounds for hope, which feeling
was soon communicated to the rest of the devoted
band.</p>

<p>It was evident that Terry or else Gibbon, perhaps,
had arrived, and that the Indians were
ready for retreat, although they intended holding
Reno under their thumbs as long as possible.</p>

<p>Word must be sent, or by some oversight the
remnant of the gallant Seventh might be left to
perish on the field, and those rifle pits become
their graves.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis at once volunteered to accomplish
this duty.</p>

<p>How he ever managed to dash through the redskins
and live, will probably ever remain a mystery,
but he did it.</p>

<p>A bullet touched his arm, three more cut his
clothing, and, at the last instant, the cavalry
horse he rode was shot from under him; but in
spite of all this, the brave ranger carried the
news to General Terry.</p>

<p>As the soldiers advanced the Indians retired,
and the remnant of the Seventh Cavalry was
saved.</p>

<p>Sleep seemed very sweet to those tired heroes
that night; that much I can vouch for.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Hold!" Mason shouted this word as if he
possessed the fire of a Forest or an Edwin Booth.</p>

<p>Involuntarily the giant became motionless. It
was only for a few seconds, however, and the
deadly knife would have descended after all.</p>

<p>A pistol crack rang out with startling distinctness,
awakening the echoes of this subterranean
place. The boy trailer had fired; his prey had
been tracked down, and the closing scene of the
tragedy drew near.</p>

<p>Red Goliath dropped his blade with a howl, and
clapped his hand up to his left shoulder, where
the lodging-place of the bullet could be seen by
the blood that wet his flannel shirt.</p>

<p>Two inches from his heart; not a bad shot, considering
the excitement consequent upon the termination
of the chase, and the dim light afforded
by the cracks above, and yet it came very near
costing the boy his life.</p>

<p>After shooting, in his eagerness to prevent the
monster from doing Adele any harm in his dying
moments (thinking his shot fatal), Mason sprang
forward and presented his revolver.</p>

<p>It was a bad move on his part. Although agile
beyond all calculation, his excitement made him
less cautious than was his custom.</p>

<p>Red Goliath gave a singular cry when the boy
appeared, for he recognized him at once, even
though the young gentleman he had seen in
New Orleans was now clad in the fanciful garb of
a hunter.</p>

<p>In spite of his astonishment, the man did not
lose his presence of mind an iota.</p>

<p>He saw the leveled revolver, and gave it a knock
that sent the weapon spinning to the other end of
the cavern, and the next instant the boy was
clasped by the giant's one useful arm.</p>

<p>Once in that grasp, Mason's struggles were
those of an infant, and he was soon thrown upon
his back. A heavy knee upon his chest held him
down, and he was compelled to see the giant
reach over and, with his left arm, pick up the
long knife.</p>

<p>Then eye glared at eye.</p>

<p>Mason's did not flinch at the blood-shot orbs
that were fastened upon him.</p>

<p>He saw that blade ascend, but beyond a slight
shudder it did not seem to affect him.</p>

<p>Red Goliath now realized what a climax affairs
had reached, and he could not forego the temptation
to tantalize the boy before dispatching him.</p>

<p>"There you lie, my little man, and there you're
going to lie forever. Thought to get the best of
me, did you? Aha! Red Goliath has passed
through the jaws of death too often to give in to
a mere stripling. The fates work in my favor.
Hoskins found out what it meant to meddle with
such a dangerous customer; now I'm going to
give you a taste. Say your prayers, young man,
for your seconds are numbered on this earth."</p>

<p>Higher rose the blade, as the giant gathered
strength for a mighty stroke.</p>

<p>Yet the boy's eyes did not quiver, but remained
fastened on those of his enemy. A minute would
seem an eternity at such a time.</p>

<p>Red Goliath was purposely delaying his blow,
to make the death agony more potent; but he
hesitated too long.</p>

<p>A hand that could grip like a vise caught the
upraised arm, and the giant looked up to find
himself face to face with Chevalier Bolly Wherrit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT FATE HAS ORDAINED.</p>


<p>Adele had for ancestors, on her father's side
of the house, valiant Frenchmen, and she inherited
some of their courage.</p>

<p>Red Goliath had paid no attention to her after
Mason so suddenly appeared upon the scene of
action, and in this disregard he proved his complete
ignorance of the young girl's bravery.</p>

<p>When she saw the one she loved so well in the
power of this rough assassin, all fear fled for the
time being from her heart, and she was brave.</p>

<p>While she alone had been threatened Adele
could not help being terror-stricken, but now the
case was quite altered.</p>

<p>The revolver that had been knocked from
Mason's hand (General Custer's revolver) lay
near the young girl. Her eyes had followed its
course through the air mechanically, and as she
realized what power lay in the little weapon, her
eyes flashed. She sprang forward and picked it
up.</p>

<p>Just at this instant a man clad in a buckskin,
and whose face bore the impress of nature's
nobleman, stepped into view. He held up a hand
toward Adele, as if telling her to remain a passive
spectator, and she, willing to trust her cause in
such hands, suffered the revolver that had been
raised with so determined a purpose to fall to her
side.</p>

<p>One bound, like that of a panther, served to
bring Bolly Wherrit in a position where he could
enter into the game. As his iron hand came
down upon the brawny arm of the giant Hercules,
the latter looked up with a startled look. It was
his last word upon earth, the curse he uttered;
for the ranger buried his knife in that broad chest,
with the force of an avenger, and threw the dying
monster upon the rocky floor. Mason sprang
up and took Adele away to the other end of the
cavern, in order that she might not witness what
a terrible thing death was.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell upon the convulsive movements
of the stricken giant.</p>

<p>Twice he essayed to pull out a revolver, but
each time Bolly kicked his arm; and thus foiled
of his devilish purpose, the savage man died,
foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>Bolly stood contemplating the body with folded
arms.</p>

<p>There was something fascinating, and at the
same time repulsive, in the bulky form lying so
quiet in the arms of death, and the gray-haired
ranger shook his head as he turned away.</p>

<p>"It run agin the grain, that blow did, but 'twar
either his life or yers, and I took the choice. He
was a fine man in shape, but a devil in mind.
Wal, it's the fate o' us all; and the only wonder
air how ye've 'scaped so long. Young feller, I
reckon az how yer name must be Mason Pierrepont?"
said the ranger.</p>

<p>"It is, sir, and to whom are we indebted for
this great service," said the boy, clasping an arm
tighter around Adele than the circumstances
seemed to warrant, seeing that she was only an
adopted daughter of his mother.</p>

<p>His words contained a dignity that compelled
Bolly to respect him.</p>

<p>"Bolly Wherrit air my name, tho' that ain't o'
much consequence. Yer mother engaged me to
come arter the leetle gal yonder. Unfortunately
I war taken prisoner, but escaped during the
fight yesterday. Kin ye tell me anything about
it?"</p>

<p>Mason graphically, but concisely, gave an account
of Custer's annihilation, at which the old
ranger stood aghast, and it was several moments
before he recovered.</p>

<p>"Heavens! but thet war orful. Arter that I'm
death on the reds. And ye say my chum Pandy
Ellis war in it? If they've rubbed out&mdash;but no;
sech a thing air impossible; Pandy couldn't die so
easy. Custer kilt Black Sculley wid his last shot,
did he? Then thar's another boarder jest gone.
But poor Custer, an' Cooke, handsome Cooke,
and Yates, wid whom I've bunked many's the
time. Poor boys, it's a bad piece o' bizness, but
ef they've kilt my Pandy Ellis, then the world
won't be big enuff ter hide ole Sitting Bull an'
his chiefs from Bolly Wherrit's rifle;" and the
set teeth proclaimed every word meant as it was
uttered.</p>

<p>By comparing notes, Mason and the ranger
came to a good understanding, and realized the
situation of affairs across the river pretty accurately.</p>

<p>It was while they were debating as to their
future course, that an alarm occurred in the
shape of the sudden appearance of an Indian,
who had stumbled upon the cave by accident, as
his surprise would seem to indicate.</p>

<p>The prairie ranger proved too quick for the red
American, however, and hurling himself upon
the Indian, he brought him to the ground.</p>

<p>Here he was speedily secured, with Mason's
assistance, and rolled into a corner for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>Fearing lest more of these unwelcome guests
should make their appearance, Bolly took his station
in the passage leading to the cavern, and
there remained all night, while Mason and Adele
slept within, or at least made a pretense of sleeping.</p>

<p>But the darkness passed away without any
alarm, and daylight found them in the same order,
only that all signs of the dead giant had
strangely vanished from the cavern, in which
mystery Bolly was a participant.</p>

<p>Leaving the others, the ranger went out on a
scout, and came back in an hour or so with the
news that the remainder of the cavalry were intrenched
among the hills on the other side of the
river, and battling with the Sioux.</p>

<p>Bolly also brought with him the choice portion
of a deer he had shot.</p>

<p>It took but a short time to gather fuel, and soon
the olfactories of our friends were greeted by the
delicious aroma of roasting venison.</p>

<p>Breakfast dispatched, the situation was discussed
again, and at the end of the council it
was decided best to remain where they were, and
await the movement of the troops.</p>

<p>Mason being acquainted with Custer's intended
plans of operation, knew that Terry might be
expected, and it might be safer for them to leave
in the care of the soldiers, for the vicinity seemed
swarming with Indians.</p>

<p>Thus the day passed.</p>

<p>In the evening Bolly took another scout, and
witnessed the arrival of General Terry's men.</p>

<p>He was soon with the heroes who had fought
so long under Major Reno, and almost the first
person he ran across was his chum.</p>

<p>It would have done a philosopher good to have
witnessed the meeting between these great-hearted
men, each of whom feared the other was
dead.</p>

<p>A pressure of the hand that spoke volumes was
followed by the expressive glance.</p>

<p>Words fail on such an occasion to convey the
idea that other things can tell.</p>

<p>Bolly did not wait to see any of the officers, although
many of them were known to him, but
rushed his chum to the other side of the river,
where he made him acquainted with Mason and
Adele.</p>

<p>That night the quartette of friends spent in the
cave, enjoying themselves with yarns and good
cheer.</p>

<p>In the morning, Bolly proposed a start, urged
by the young girl's desire to see home, and the
agony of that lady mother in the Southern city,
whose tears had accomplished what money alone
could never have done.</p>

<p>After reaching Laramie, rapid transit was obtained,
and, before many days passed by, the
city of New Orleans was reached.</p>

<p>Madame Pierrepont fulfilled all her promises
to Bolly, and still thinks that everything she owns
would be inadequate to recompense him for saving
her dear son and adopted daughter.</p>

<p>I have grave suspicions (aroused by some of
young Mason's warm <i>brotherly</i> actions) that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
time is not far distant when his wealthy mother
will receive pretty Adele as her own daughter,
but perhaps they are too young as yet for more
than surmises on my part.</p>

<p>Pandy Ellis and his partner started for the
field of action again, and by the time this reaches
the reader's eye, they will doubtless be at the
side of impetuous Major Burt or some other of
Cooke's gallant officers.</p>

<p>On their way we lose sight of these princes of
the prairies, but let us hope it will not be forever.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Custer!</p>

<p>His memory will ever be green in the memory
of his fellow-soldiers.</p>

<p>The whole country mourns his loss, and well
they may, for a more dashing, chivalrous, valiant
cavalry chief never led his men to battle, and
though willful at times, his other qualities completely
hid this fault.</p>

<p>Who among us can stand forth, and pointing to
himself, say, "Look at me, and take a lesson. I
am faultless?" Not one, I am sure.</p>

<p>And with Custer fell the flower of the army;
noble men whose names shall ever be cherished
by all lovers of the good and brave.</p>

<p>That Pandy Ellis was their first real avenger
the reader already knows.</p>

<p>Whether retribution shall overtake Sitting Bull
and his warriors, or not, time alone will tell.</p>

<p>As to the movements of the troops under Terry,
also those under Cooke, the reader can glean
fresher news from the daily papers than I can
give.</p>

<p>At present it seems that the Northwest will be
the scene of a bloody Indian war which can only
terminate with the extermination of the warriors
engaged.</p>

<p>As to Pedro Sanchez, he has recovered from the
wounds received at the hands of his former companion,
Red Goliath, but trembles whenever left
alone, for he has in some way heard of the terrible
oath sworn by Pandy Ellis to have his life;
and if there is one man in the world whom the
French Spaniard fears it is the veteran trapper
chief.</p>

<p>From the limited papers at my command I
have drawn this tale out of the terrible death-ride
still so fresh in the public mind, and now that
Custer has gone to join his brave fellow-officers
in the spirit world, I hope all his faults, such as
they were, may be overlooked, and due reverence
shown for the name of our missing hero.</p>
